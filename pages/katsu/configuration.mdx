# Configuration

Katsu images are defined using "Manifests".

A manifest is a modular YAML file that defines the content inside the image, and
scripts to run when the image is built.

A manifest is made up of a number of sections, each of which is optional. However, though some sections should only be defined
by a manifest that will be used as an entrypoint so the image can be functional.

## Sections

### `builder`

The `builder` section defines the image that will be used to build the image. This is currently limited to only DNF
based images.

```yaml
builder: dnf
```

### `distro`

This section defines the product name of the image. It is used for ISO images to name the boot entry.

```yaml
distro: Fedora 39
```

### `scripts`

This section defines the scripts that will be run before and after the image is built.

They have two sub-sections, `pre` and `post`, which define the scripts to run before and after the image is built.
Both of these has the same format described below.

The contents in the subsections are defined as arrays.

```yaml
scripts:
    pre:
        - inline: |
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "Hello World"
        id: hello-world
        name: Hello World
        - file: ./hello-world.sh
          id: hello-world-file
```

#### `scripts.*.[].inline`

A string containing the script to run, can be replaced with `file` (optional)

#### `scripts.*.[].file`

A path to a file containing the script to run, can be replaced with `inline` (optional)

#### `scripts.*.[].id`

A unique identifier for the script, used for dependency trees, similar to how Ansible works (optional)

#### `scripts.*.[].needs`

A list of script IDs that must be run before this script (optional)

#### `scripts.*.[].name`

A name for the script, used for logging (optional)

---

Files should be placed in the same directory as the manifest file that loads it.
So if the manifest that loads `hello-world-file` is in `modules/hello.yaml`, the file should be in `modules/hello-world.sh`

---

The best practice is to create a separate folder for each module, and place the required files in that folder.

### `dnf`

This section configures the DNF package manager.

```yaml
dnf:
  releasever: 39
  repodir: /etc/yum.repos.d
  options:
    - --setopt=install_weak_deps=False
    - --nogpgcheck
  exclude:
    - foo
    - bar
  packages:
    - baz

  arch_packages:
    x86_64:
      - baz-x86_64
    aarch64:
      - baz-aarch64
```

#### `dnf.releasever`

The release version DNF should pull repos from, replaces DNF's `$releasever` variable.

#### `dnf.repodir`

The directory to load repositories from.

#### `dnf.options`

A list of additional arguments to pass to DNF.

#### `dnf.exclude`

A list of packages to exclude from the image.

#### `dnf.packages`

A list of packages to install in the image.
This can also be any DNF spec string that DNF understands, such as `@core` or `foo.x86_64`

#### `dnf.arch_packages`

A map of packages to install for each architecture. The key is the architecture, and the value is a list of packages to install.

#### `dnf.arch_exclude`

A map of packages to exclude from the image per each architecture. The key is the architecture, and the value is a list of packages to exclude from the image.

### `disk`

This section configures the disk layout (GPT only)

```yaml
disk:
  size: 8GiB
  partitions:
    - label: EFI
      size: 512MiB
      filesystem: efi
      mountpoint: /boot/efi

    - label: boot
      size: 1GiB
      filesystem: ext4
      mountpoint: /boot

    - label: root
      filesystem: ext4
      mountpoint: /
```

#### `disk.size`

The total size of the disk image, defined by [bytesize]

#### `disk.partitions`

A list of partitions to create on the disk.

##### `disk.partitions.[].label`

The label of the partition

##### `disk.partitions.[].size`

The size of the partition, defined by [bytesize]

##### `disk.partitions.[].filesystem`

The filesystem to format the partition with `mkfs`

##### `disk.partitions.[].mountpoint`

The mountpoint to mount the partition at relative to the root of the image.

---

The order of the partitions is important, as they are created in the order they are defined, however, mountpoints will be sorted
by nesting level, so `/` will be mounted first, then `/boot`, then `/boot/efi`. This is done using a topological sort algorithm.

If the mountpoint depths are the same, they will be sorted alphabetically.

---

### `import.[]`

File paths to other manifests to import and merge into the current manifest during runtime. Must be relative to the current manifest.

Not all attributes get merged when importing another manfiest. The following
attributes are not merged:

- `bootloader`
- `iso`
- `disk`
- `dnf` with the exception of
  - `dnf.packages`
  - `dnf.arch_packages`
  - `dnf.arch_exclude`
  - `dnf.options`
  - `dnf.exclude`
  - `dnf.repodir`

```yaml
import:
  - ./modules/hello.yaml
```

### `users.[]`

A list of users to create in the image.

#### `users.[].name`

The username of the user

#### `users.[].password`

The password of the user, must be hashed using `crypt(3)`

#### `users.[].uid`

The UID of the user

#### `users.[].gid`

The GID of the user

#### `users.[].groups.[]`

A list of groups to add the user to

#### `users.[].shell`

The shell of the user

#### `users.[].ssh_keys.[]`

A list of SSH keys to add to the user's `authorized_keys` file

#### `users.[].create_home`

Whether to create the user's home directory

Must be a boolean, defaults to `true`
