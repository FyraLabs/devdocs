<Callout type="warning">
  This is an **unofficial** documentation for RPM.
</Callout>

## Foreword

We understand that RPM, as one of the components in the Fedora / RedHat ecosystem,
is one of the most undocumented packaging systems, and we would like to change that.
We believe by thoroughly documenting Fedora-specific and other RPM macros, we could
make packaging easier to get started for everyone.
Providing the most up-to-date RPM documentations on the Internet could benefit everyone
in the ecosystem, which is why we made this unofficial documentation.

We provided this document pretty without any restrictions, i.e. you have the freedom
to do whatever you want. However, we would really appreciate if you could also give back
to [Terra], packaging a few apps you find possibly useful to other people using Fedora into Terra.

We hope you find this document useful.
