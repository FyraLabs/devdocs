# RPM Expression

RPM expressions is a "sublanguage" in RPM.
From the [RPM manual],

> Expression expansion can be performed using `%[expression]`.  An
> expression consists of terms that can be combined using
> operators.  Rpm supports three kinds of terms, numbers made up
> from digits, strings enclosed in double quotes (eg `"somestring"`) and
> versions enclosed in double quotes preceded by v (eg `v"3:1.2-1"`).
> Rpm will expand macros when evaluating terms.
> 
> You can use the standard operators to combine terms: logical
> operators `&&`, `||`, `!`, relational operators `!=`, `==`, `<`,
> `>`, `<=`, `>=`, arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`,
> the ternary operator `? :`, and parentheses.
> For example, `%[ 3 + 4 * (1 + %two) ]` will expand
> to "15" if `%two` expands to "2". Version terms are compared using
> rpm version ([epoch:]version[-release]) comparison algorithm,
> rather than regular string comparison.
> 
> Note that the `%[expression]` expansion is different to the
> `%{expr:expression}` macro.  With the latter, the macros in the
> expression are expanded first and then the expression is
> evaluated (without re-expanding the terms).  Thus
> 
> ```sh
> rpm --define 'foo 1 + 2' --eval '%{expr:%foo}'
> ```
> 
> will print "3".  Using `%[%foo]` instead will result in the
> error that "1 + 2" is not a number.
> 
> Doing the macro expansion when evaluating the terms has two
> advantages.  First, it allows rpm to do correct short-circuit
> processing when evaluation logical operators.  Second, the
> expansion result does not influence the expression parsing,
> e.g. `%["%file"]` will even work if the `%file` macro expands
> to a string that contains a double quote.

This section digs into more of the advanced and technical details.

First, a (way simpler) Rust declarative implementation is available
[in `rpmspec-rs`](https://github.com/rpm-rs/rpmspec-rs/blob/master/rpmexpr/src/lib.rs).

<Callout type="info">
  The following section uses the following symbols:
  - 游릻: 2 inputs must be of the same type.
  - 游릴: not fallible (i.e. never produces an error), given 游릻 is satisfied.
</Callout>

Second, there are 4 unary, 10 binary, and 1 tertiary operators:
- `-a`: negate a numerical value.
  - Err when used on non-numerical values.
- `!a`: negate the value, return either 1 or 0. 游릴
  - Non-zero numbers when negated produce `0`.
  - Non-empty texts/strings when negated produce `0`.
  - Other values (including versions) produce `1`.
- `a && b`: the "and" operator. 游릻游릴
  - Num: `0` unless both values are non-zero.
  - Text: `0` unless both values are not empty.
  - Ver: always produce `a`.
- `a || b`: the "or" operator. 游릻游릴
  - Num: `1` unless both values are zero.
  - Text: `1` unless both values are empty.
  - Ver: always produce `b`.
- `a != b` 游릻游릴
- `a == b` 游릻游릴
- `a < b` 游릻游릴
- `a > b` 游릻游릴
- `a <= b` 游릻游릴
- `a >= b` 游릻游릴
- `a + b` 游릻
  - Num: Addition of 2 numbers
  - Text: Joining 2 texts together (without spaces in the middle)
  - Ver: Err
- `a - b` 游릻
  - The same as `a + (-b)`
- `a / b` 游릻
  - Num: if `b != 0`, performs division.
  - Otherwise err.
- `a * b`
  - Num: performs multiplication.
  - Otherwise err.
- `a ? b : c` 游릴
  - `b`, `c` 游릻
  - If `!!a` produces `1`, evaluate to `b`.
  - Otherwise, evaluate to `c`.
