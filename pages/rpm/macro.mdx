# Macro Syntax

RPM is a very powerful packaging system. One very reason is its macro support.

A macro is a piece of "shorthand" identifier that expands to some content. Arguments can be fed
into macros to obtain different desired results. It is similar to "functions" or "procedures"
in programming terms.

Macros in RPM are denoted by a `%` (U+0025 PERCENT SIGN) prefix, and can be further
split into 3 separate categories:

1. `%{rpm_macro}`: normal RPM macros. When someone says "macro", they probably are referring
   to this.
2. `%(echo "hi" | sed 's/hi/hello/')`: shell macros that expands to the output of the commands.
3. `%[v"1.2.3~1" < v"1.2.3"]`: RPM [expression](./expr).

[For the first type, here is a list of the documented macros](./macros).

The second type is pretty straightforward: by writing shell expressions wrapped around `%(…)`,
it expands to the output (stdout).

[The third type is documented here](./expr).

The `%` character can be escaped. If you want to say `echo %hello` without expanding the `%hello`
macro, you are looking for `echo %%hello`.

## Macro Name

The macro name (i.e. the identifier of the macro) must match the regex
```ts
/^(?!_$)[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$/
```

There are exceptions to this rule, but as far as macros defined by the users (packagers),
this MUST be followed. Of course, this document [mentions all exceptions](#automatic-macros).

The RPM manual claims that the name "must be at least 3 characters in length"[^1]
but as far as concerned that is the biggest lie in the century:
```sh
$ rpm -D 'a 1' -E '%a'
1
```

## Invoking Macros

Let's look at an example:
```rpmspec
%{_bindir}
```

Normally this expands to `/usr/bin`. In many cases, you don't actually need the `{}`:

```rpmspec
%_bindir
```

This also expands to `/usr/bin`. When dealing with normal unparameterized macros,
if the next character matches the regex `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` (i.e. the next character is
a valid character in a macro identifier), `{}` must be used to avoid ambiguity.
In other cases, the macro may be written with or without `{}`.

In cases where it is necessary to pass arguments in a macro invocation in an inline context,
there are two different ways:
```sh
$ rpm -D 'x(p) %1' -E '%{x:123 -p a b}' # using a colon
123 -x a b

$ rpm -D 'x(p) %1' -E '%{x 123 -p a b}' # using a space
123

$ rpm -D 'x(p) %1' -E '%{x:-p}'
%1
```

Using a `:` means you are passing everything afterwards as one single argument,
as if you are using [`%{quote:…}`](#quote). Meanwhile, using a space (at least for
[parameterized macros](#parameterized-macros)) is equivalent to invoking it
normally — the arguments are processed as expected.

## Defining Macros

When running `rpm --eval '…'{:sh}` or `rpm -E '…'{:sh}`, you may want to define a macro
valid only for that command. In that case, use `--define 'macro_name macro_body'`, or
`-D 'macro_name macro_body'`.

If you are writing a macro definition in a spec file, use one of:
```rpmspec
%define macro_name    macro_body
%global macro_name(-) macro_body
```

See documentations for [`%define`](./macros#define) and [`%global`](./macros#global).

If you are writing a macro definition in `%_rpmmacrodir` (⇒ `/usr/lib/rpm/macros.d`):

```rpmspec
%macro_name    macro_body
%macro_name(-) macro_body
```

### Escaping

When the macro body spans multiple lines, an unescaped `\` may be needed at the end of each
line except the last line of the macro body. To write the character `\`, use `\\`. 
Since the same shell command when spanned multiple lines requires the same mechanism,
in many cases you will need to use `\\\`:

<Split>
	<Split.Left>
		```rpmspec filename="/usr/lib/rpm/macros.d/macros.example"
		%say_hello echo \\\
		Hello, World! && \\\
		echo This is from the %%say_hello macro! \
		echo This is a second line of shell command. && \\\
		echo Pretty cool.
		```
	</Split.Left>
	<Split.Right>
		```sh
		$ rpm -E '%say_hello'
		echo \
		Hello, World! && \
		echo This is from the %say_hello macro!
		echo This is a second line of shell command. && \
		echo Pretty cool.
		```
	</Split.Right>
</Split>

<Split>
	<Split.Left>
		```rpmspec filename="/usr/lib/rpm/macros.d/macros.example"
		%say_hello %{lua:
			print("echo 'Hello, ")
			-- you also need to escape backslash for the new line character in lua strings
			print("World!'\\n")
			-- macros in lua are not expanded by default, so %% is not needed here
			print("echo 'from %say_hello using %{lua:…}!'")
		}
		```
	</Split.Left>
	<Split.Right>
		```sh
		$ rpm -E '%say_hello'
		echo 'Hello, World!'
		echo 'from %say_hello using %{lua:…}!'
		```
	</Split.Right>
</Split>

But that does not mean `\` is needed when dealing with a multi-line macro body.

For definition files in `/usr/lib/rpm/macros.d/`, strictly speaking, RPM assumes
a blank line separates different macro definitions. Therefore, no macro body may be written
with any blank lines present. Blank lines must end with a `\`:

```rpmspec filename="/usr/lib/rpm/macros.d/macros.rust-srpm" showLineNumbers {14,18,23}
# rust_arches: list of architectures where building Rust is supported
#
# Since RPM itself now depends on Rust code (via its GPG backend, rpm-sequoia),
# this list will probably always be a superset of all architectures that are
# supported by Fedora, which is why it is no longer required to set
# "ExclusiveArch: rust_arches" for Rust packages in Fedora.
%rust_arches x86_64 %{ix86} armv7hl aarch64 ppc64 ppc64le riscv64 s390x

# version_no_tilde: lua macro for reconstructing the original crate version
#       from the RPM version (i.e. replace any "~" characters with "-")
%version_no_tilde() %{lua:
    local sep = rpm.expand('%1')
    local ver = rpm.expand('%2')
\
    if sep == '%1' then
        sep = '-'
    end
\
    if ver == '%2' then
        ver = rpm.expand('%version')
    end
    ver = ver:gsub('~', sep)
\
    print(ver)
}
…
```

<Callout type="info">
  Mado: I don't know the actual complete rule for this to be honest (which is why `rpmspec-rs`
  is so broken right now) but generally speaking if your macro body does not start with `%{lua:`,
  you'll need `\` at the end of each line.
</Callout>

### Comments

In [`%{lua:…}`](./macros#lua), comments must start with `-- ` (with the space).
`# …` is not accepted. Note that `#` is a special operator in Lua for obtaining the length of an
array or a string.

Otherwise, `#` is fine outside of Lua code.

See also: [`%{dnl:…}`](./macros#dnl)

## Conditionally Expanded Macros

<div style={{ float: "right", marginLeft: "1em", marginTop: "1em" }}>
```sh
$ rpm -E '%a'
%a
$ rpm -E '%!a'
%a
$ rpm -E '%!?a'

$ rpm -E '%??a'

$ rpm -E '%!!a'
%a
```
</div>

For any `%{macro}` invocations, you may append `!` or `?` zero to infinitely many times to the
start of the macro name.

While generally adding more than a single `?` is the same as having just one `?`, 
the same is not true for `!` — the behavior flips for each addition of `!`.

The expansion also changes slightly with or without `{}`. When in doubt,
try testing it yourself using `rpm --eval{:sh}`.

<div style={{ float: "left", marginRight: "1em", marginTop: "1em" }}>
```sh
$ rpm -D 'x 1' -E \
 '%[0%?x ? "y" : "n"]'
y
$ rpm -E \
 '%[0%?x ? "y" : "n"]'
n
```
</div>

`%{?x:content}` checks whether `%x` is defined. If so,
it expands to the content (`%{?x}` / `%?x` is the same as `%{?x:%x}`).
Otherwise, it reduces to nothing.
In contrast, `!?` / `?!` always expand to nothing regardless.

If you are looking for something analogous to the tertiary operator,
use [RPM expression](./expr) as demonstrated on the left.


| Invocation | `%x` ⇒ `1` | `%x` undefined | Explanation
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------- | -----------
| `%x`       | `1`        | `%x`           | undefined macros are not expanded
| `%?x`      | `1`        | `` ``          | defined ⇒ `1`, undefined ⇒ nothing
| `%??x`     | `1`        | `` ``          | having multiple `?` is the same
| `%!x`      | `1`        | `%x`           | same as `%x`
| `%{!x}`    | `1`        | `%{!x}`        | `%{!x}` is undefined ⇒ not expanded
| `%!?x`     | `` ``      | `` ``          | expand to nothing
| `%?!x`     | `` ``      | `` ``          | expand to nothing
| `%!!x`     | `1`        | `%x`           | same as `%x`
| `%?!!x`    | `1`        | `` ``          | same as `%?x`
| `%?!!!x`   | `` ``      | `` ``          | same as `%?!x`
| `%?!!!!x`  | `1`        | `` ``          | same as `%?!!x`
| `%{?x:y}`  | `y`        | `` ``          | if defined ⇒ `y`
| `%{?!x:y}` | `` ``      | `y`            | if undefined ⇒ `y`


## Parameterized Macros

<div style={{ float: "right", marginLeft: "1em", marginTop: "1em" }}>
```rpmspec filename="greet"
%greet(-) %{echo:Hello %*!}
```
```sh filename="Shell"
rpm -E '%{load:greet}
%greet world
%greet Linux Torvalds'
```
```ansi filename="Output"
Hello world!
Hello Linux Torvalds!
​
​
```
</div>

From the manual[^2]:
> RPM has fully recursive spec file macros. Simple macros do straight text substitution. **Parameterized macros include an options field, and perform argc/argv processing on white space separated tokens to the next newline**. During macro expansion, both flags and arguments are available as macros which are deleted at the end of macro expansion. Macros can be used (almost) anywhere in a spec file, and, in particular, in “included file lists” (i.e. those read in using `%files -f <file>{:rpmspec}`). In addition, macros can be nested, hiding the previous definition for the duration of the expansion of the macro which contains nested macros.

Parameterized macros are also known as "parametric macros":
> **A macro which contains an `(opts)` field is called parametric**. The opts (i.e. string between parentheses) are passed exactly as is to to [`getopt(3)`] for argc/argv processing at the beginning of a macro invocation. Only short options are supported. **`--` can be used to separate options from arguments**. Since rpm >= 4.17 `-` as opts disables all option processing.

### Automatic Macros

While a parameterized macro is being expanded, the following special automatic macros are available:

| Macro         | Description
| ------------- | -----------
| `%0`          | name of invoked macro
| `%*`          | all arguments (unlike shell, excluding processed flags)
| `%**`         | all arguments (including processed flags)
| `%#`          | number of arguments excluding processed flags
| `%{-f}`       | if present at invocation, the last occurence of flag f (flag and argument)
| `%{-f*}`      | if present at invocation, the argument to the last occurence of flag f
| `%1`, `%2`, … | arguments unattached to flags (after [`getopt(3)`] processing)

With rpm >= 4.17 and disabled option processing (i.e. `%my_macro(-)`),
the mentioned macros are defined as:

| Macro         | Description 
| -----------   | ----------- 
| `%0`          | name of invoked macro
| `%*`, `%**`   | all arguments
| `%#`          | number of arguments
| `%1`, `%2`, … | arguments themselves

### The `(opts)` field [#opts]

The `(opts)` field might be confusing at first but it's actually pretty simple (since RPM only accepts short flags).
In case you are not familiar with [`getopt(3)`], there are basically 3 rules:
- for each character in `(…)`, it represents a flag.
	- `(ABCxyz)` means `-A`, `-B`, `-C`, `-x`, `-y`, `-z` are possible flags
	- only ASCII characters that are not `-`, `:` and `;` are accepted
- any of the above characters followed by a single colon `:` indicates the flag *requires* an argument.
	- `(n:)` means the macro expects `-n <…>` (or the caller can just not supply any flags at all)
- any followed by a double colon `::` indicates the flag takes in an *optional* argument.
	- `(x::)` means `-x` or `-x[…]` are both accepted
	- Macro flags using `::` MUST NOT have a space between them and the argument passed to them if used with an argument.

Special: `(-)` means no flags are processed:

```sh
$ rpm -D 'p() %**' -E '%p -o'
p: invalid option -- 'o'
error: Unknown option o in p()

$ rpm -D 'p(-) %**' -E '%p -o'
-o
```

## Regex in RPM

Regex in RPM has some notable differences especially when it comes to escapes.

For example, if you wanted to escape a literal dot (`.`), you would need `\\.` instead of `\.`.

And if you need a literal backslash (`\`), you would then need `\\\\`.

In [Lua macros](/rpm/macros#lua) this can get even more complicated as you must sometimes escape in Lua *and* RPM.

For example, if you need a `.`, in Lua macros you need to escape this as `\\\\.`.
