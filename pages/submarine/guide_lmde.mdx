# Installing Linux Mint Debian Edition with Submarine

## Partitioning

Ensure that you disk uses a GPT partition table.

1. Create a 16mb partition, this is where Submarine will be.

2. Add the neccesary flags with `cgpt add -i <partition number> -t kernel -P 15 -T 1 -S 1 /dev/sdX`, dont forget to put the correct values for your disk.

3. Now you can flash `submarine-<arch>.kpart` to this partition!

4. Submarine needs GRUB to be able to boot the distro, so create a second partition (anywhere from 64-256mb).

5. Finally, create a third partition that will house your system. It can be any size but filling the rest of the disk would be the most logical.

## Installation

Now you can begin installing your system to the drive, proceed with the usual installation until you get to the partition screen. This is where you need to mount the third (system) partition as `/`, and the second (grub) partition as `/boot/efi`. If asked, you should install the grub menu to the second partition.

The rest should be handled by the installer like normal.

## Postinstall

You are ready to use the drive with your Chromebook! Once the Submarine menu boots up and shows the list of options, select the number which corresponds to your system.

After installing, you should use [Tree's audio script](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio) to get audio working, note that this will create a new kernel, and will have a new entry in the boot menu which you should select.
