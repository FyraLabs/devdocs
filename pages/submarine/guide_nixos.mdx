# Install NixOS with Submarine

Note: While ARM images could technically be built aswell, they are not considered ready and therefore are not supported.

## Prepare an image

1. Either dowmload a `raw-x64cros` image [from CI](https://github.com/ninelore/flake/actions/workflows/images.yml) or follow the [build instructions](https://github.com/ninelore/flake/blob/main/README.md#build-instructions)

2. Write the image to an external media using `dd`.

3. Reminder: to boot Submarine from external media, you first need to run the following commands as root.

```bash
sudo enable_dev_usb_boot
```

4. Reboot, and on the Developer Mode screen, press Ctrl+U to boot from external media.

## Partitioning

1. After booting the image, establish network connection with NetworkManager (`nmtui` or `nmcli`).

2. When partitioning the drive, the first partition should be a 16MB partition (64MB on aarch64) for Submarine. You do not need to create a EFI system partition (ESP) as Submarine does not use UEFI.

3. Set the necessary flags for the Submarine partition with `cgpt add -i <partition number> -t kernel -P 15 -T 1 -S 1 /dev/sdX`, substituting `<partition number>` for the number of the Submarine partition and `/dev/sdX` for the block device of your internal drive.

4. Get Submarine by running the following command.

```bash
nix build github:ninelore/flake#submarine
```

5. Write the Submarine `.kpart` found in `result/share/submarine/` to the Submarine partition created earlier using `dd`.

## Installing

Proceed to install NixOS like you would from the official minimal ISO. Here is a quick tl;dr:

1. Mount your filesystem to `/mnt`, do not mount the Submarine partition.

2. Run `nixos-generate-config --root /mnt` to generate a basic NixOS configuration in `/mnt/etc/nixos/`.

3. Configure your system by editing `/mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` or bring your existing configuration.

4. Once your configuration is ready, run `nixos-install`.

## Postinstall

After you've finished installing, reboot and press Ctrl+D to boot from internal disk. If you did everything right, you should be looking at the Submarine boot menu. Select the number that corresponds to your new NixOS Generation to boot into NixOS.

For audio fixes for running Linux on Chromebooks, take a look at the [NixOS Modules provided in ninelore's flake](https://github.com/ninelore/flake).
