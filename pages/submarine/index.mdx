description: Bootstrap a Linux system on Depthcharge with Submarine
---

### Section Under Construction

Submarine provides a minimal Linux environment that lives in a small partition (16mb) on the disk. 
We use this environment to bootstrap a full Linux system (or a different system if you're brave.)


## Prebuilt Images

We offer prebuilt versions of the images per each commit:

- [Latest x86_64 build](https://nightly.link/FyraLabs/submarine/workflows/build/main/submarine-x86_64.zip)
- [Latest arm64 build](https://nightly.link/FyraLabs/submarine/workflows/build/main/submarine-arm64.zip)

## Dependencies

Please make sure you have these dependencies first before building.

```bash
make
gcc
flex
bison
elfutils-devel
parted
vboot-utils
golang
xz
bc
openssl-devel
```

Additionally, you'll need to install u-root. To install the latest version:

```bash
go install github.com/u-root/u-root@latest
```

## Building

Simply clone this repo with submodules, so pass `--recurse-submodules` to `git clone`, then:

```bash
make -j$(nproc) <x86_64|arm64>
```

Please note that you **must** pass an architecture target.

The build output is located in `build/`.
For testing, an image is built at `build/submarine.bin` which you can directly flash onto an external drive.
So, for example, replace `/dev/sdX` with the device file of the external drive:

```bash
sudo dd if=build/submarine.bin of=/dev/sdX
```
