Chips help people with entering information, making selections, filtering content, or triggering actions.

Chips can show multiple interactive elements together in the same area, such as a list of selectable movie times, or a series of email contacts.

Chips use tags or descriptive words to filter content. They can be a good alternative to toggles or checkboxes.
