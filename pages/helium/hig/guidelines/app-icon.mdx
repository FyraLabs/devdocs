![The four icon shapes](/images/helium/hig/appicon.png)

An app's icon should showcase what your app does using only geometric shapes. A good icon should also be universally understandable, meaning that anyone can figure out what your app does just by seeing the icon.

HIG Compliant app icons have must:

1. Use a 128×128px canvas size to allow for uniqueness of shape and consistency of visual geometry.
2. Make the icon have a corner-radius of 24px, and a size of 104×104px within that 128×128px canvas.
2. We recommend that details are at least 4px in either width or height to allow the best appearance when the icon is used at smaller sizes.
3. Have a slight bottom-up perspective; this makes part of the front face to show.
4. That front face is shaded darker than the top surface, and should be 4px tall.
5. The top rim of the icon should be shaded lighter.
6. Avoid shadows if possible, they can be used if it is necessary to give contrast to different icon elements.
7. Avoid shapes with slight transparency (no more than 20% transparent.)

Once your icon is made, then it can be shipped with your app.

**Important**: Use the palette below to make your app icons.
