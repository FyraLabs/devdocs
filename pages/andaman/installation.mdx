# Installation

## Ultramarine Linux

Ultramarine comes with the Terra Repository; simply install Andaman!

`sudo dnf install anda`

## Fedora and Derivatives

```bash
sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra$releasever' terra-release
```

If you are using atomic editions of Fedora, run the following commands instead:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/terrapkg/subatomic-repos/raw/main/terra.repo | pkexec tee /etc/yum.repos.d/terra.repo
sudo rpm-ostree install terra-release
```

Optionally, you can install `terra-release-extra` to use the Extras repository, `terra-release-mesa` to use the Mesa repository, and `terra-release-nvidia` to use the NVIDIA repository.

Then, install Andaman

`sudo dnf install anda`

## Enterprise Linux (EL) and Derivatives

Only EL10 is supported. Not all packages available in Terra are available in Terra EL.

Terra EL requires EPEL, which may be installed with:

```bash
sudo dnf install 'https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-$releasever.noarch.rpm'
```

And Terra EL itself can be installed with:

```bash
sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terrael$releasever' terra-release
```

Then, install Andaman:

`sudo dnf install anda`

## Elsewhere

### Cargo

Andaman is available as a Rust crate:

`cargo install anda`

## Building from Source

Alternatively you can also manually download the sources from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/FyraLabs/anda
cd anda
git checkout 0.4.13
cargo install --path .
```

As of writing (2025-12-19), 0.4.13 is the latest version. You should replace this with the actual latest release.
