# Installation

## Ultramarine Linux

Ultramarine comes with the Terra Repository, simply install Andaman!

`sudo dnf install anda`

## Fedora and derivatives

```bash
sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra$releasever' terra-release
```

If you are using immutable/atomic editions of Fedora, run the following commands instead:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/terrapkg/subatomic-repos/raw/main/terra.repo | pkexec tee /etc/yum.repos.d/terra.repo
sudo rpm-ostree install terra-release
```

Optionally, you can install `terra-release-extra` to use the Extras repository. This also installs the Nvidia, and Mesa streams but does not enable them.

Then, install Andaman

`sudo dnf install anda`

## Enterprise Linux (EL) and derivatives

Only EL10 is supported. Not all packages available in Terra are available in Terra EL at this time.

Terra EL requires the EPEL repos, which may be installed with:

```bash
sudo dnf install 'https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-$releasever.noarch.rpm'
```

And Terra EL itself can be installed with:

```bash
sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terrael$releasever' terra-release
```

Then, install Andaman

`sudo dnf install anda`

## Elsewhere

### Cargo

Andaman is available as a Rust crate:

`cargo install anda`

## Building from Source

Alternatively you can also manually download the sources from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/FyraLabs/anda
cd anda
git checkout 0.4.13
cargo install --path .
```

As of writing (2025-07-31), 0.4.13 is the latest version. You should replace this with the actual latest release.
