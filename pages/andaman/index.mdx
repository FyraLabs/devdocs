# Andaman

Andaman is a modern package build toolchain designed to simplify building different package formats for different projects in the same repository.

Andaman currently supports building RPMs, OCI images, and Flatpak packages.

A brief history of Andaman can be found on the [Fyra Wiki](https://wiki.fyralabs.com/Andaman#History).
