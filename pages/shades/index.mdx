# What is a Shade?

Ultramarine Shades are community maintained versions of Ultramarine with user interfaces that aren't already or can't be Editions.

Editions are held to a set of rules:

- Have Wayland support or a reasonable plan to add Wayland support in the near future
- Be well maintained with frequent bug fixes
- Be a full desktop environment
- Be compatible with the values of Ultramarine as a project and Fyra as an organization

Shades aren't held to the same standard, meaning that things that couldn't be Editions can be Shades.

Notable examples are:

- owen-sz's Sway Shade (Not a full desktop environment)
- Find another later

## Two Levels of Shades

We categorize Shades on how reliable they will be. Regardless of the level, all Shades are reviewed by the Fyra team for major bugs and security issues.

### Choice
Shades in the Choice category must have two ore more maintainers, and the interface must have a relatively certain future.

### Sandbox
All other Shades are in the Sandbox until they reach two or more maintainers.
