When Accessing Closed Case Debugging, the Fyra SuzyQ Board is no different then using a SuzyQable, so you can just follow [MrChromebox's WP disabling page](https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/firmware/wp/disabling.html).
If you wish to dive very deep, [Google's CCD documentation](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/cr50_stab/docs/case_closed_debugging_gsc.md) is a great resource for that.
