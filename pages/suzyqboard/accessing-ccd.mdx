This information is taken from [MrChromebox's WP disabling page](https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/firmware/wp/disabling.html).
Please check it out for more information.

# Step 1: Enabling Closed Case Debugging (CCD)

1. Power on the device to the login screen (booted into Developer Mode).
2. Open VT-2 terminal: press `[CTRL+ALT+F2]` (F2 is the right arrow).
3. Login as `root`.
4. Open the CCD: run `gsctool -a -o`.
5. You will be prompted to press the `PP` (physical presence) button several times. On almost all devices, this means to press the power button. Opening the CCD requires you to press the `PP` button several times over a 2-3 minute period.
6. When the open CCD process is complete, you will see a message showing `PP Done!` and the device will reboot in Normal/Verified Boot Mode.
7. Re-enable developer mode and continue with the instructions below.

# Step 2: Disabling Write Protection

1. Power on the device to the login screen (booted into Developer Mode).
2. Open VT-2 terminal: press `[CTRL+ALT+F2]` (F2 is the right arrow).
3. Login as `root`.
4. Plug in your SuzyQable - the USB-C end normally connects to the upper/left USB-C port.
5. Verify the cable is connected properly:
    Run `ls /dev/ttyUSB*`
    The output of this command should output 3 items, `ttyUSB0`, `ttyUSB1`, and `ttyUSB2`.
    If the 3 ttyUSB devices are not listed, try reversing the orientation of the USB-C cable, and try another port. If there is still no result, there may be a problem with your cable/adapter, or your ChromeOS device may not support connecting the cable in loopback mode as is done here. In that case, connect the USB-A end of the cable to another device and run the command from there.
6. Run the following commands. This will disable hardware write protect.
    - `echo "wp false" > /dev/ttyUSB0`
    - `echo "wp false atboot" > /dev/ttyUSB0`
7. Run `echo "ccd reset factory" > /dev/ttyUSB0`.
    This ensures that you will be able to unbrick the device (if needed) using a SuzyQable.
    It also disables AP RO Firmware Verification, and is mantory if flashing the firmware on a device with a Gen2 CR50 chip (aka `Ti50`).
8. Run `gsctool -a -I` to verify the CCD is opened, and that the factory values are set.
    The current value for all CCD flags should be set to Y/Always.
9. Run `crossystem wpsw_cur` and verify it returns `0`.
10. Reboot.

# Disable AP RO Firmware Verification

On 2023+ ChromeOS devices using a Gen2 CR50 security chip (aka `Ti50`), there is a new feature where the CR50 will verify the RO portion of the AP firmware and the state of the software write protect registers (both range and enable) at boot. If you want to flash custom firmware, you **must** use the CCD method above to disable firmware write protection, regardless if the device supports disablement via battery disconnect or a jumper as well.

For more info, see the [Chromium documentation](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/guides/device/ro-firmware-unlock/) on this feature.

NOTE - If you disabled firmware WP via CCD and reset your CCD flags with `ccd reset factory` (as per the instructions above), you can skip this step, as `ccd reset factory` will set ` AllowUnverifiedRo` to `always`.

## Step 1: Verify the device has a Ti50

1. Open VT-2 terminal: press `[CTRL+ALT+F2]` (F2 is the right arrow or refresh key).
2. Login as `root`.
3. Run `gsctool -a -I | grep AllowUnverifiedRo`.
4. If that command has any output, your device has a Ti50. If you get no output or an error, your device either has a Cr50 or no GSC at all.

## Step 2: Disable RO verification

1. Unlock the GSC by running `gsctool -a -o`.
2. Run `gsctool -a -I AllowUnverifiedRo:always`.
3. Press the power button when prompted.

NOTE - If your device has a Ti50 and you don't disable RO verification, flashing full rom will (temporarily) brick the device.
Check the [MrChromebox documentation](https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/firmware/wp/disabling.html#recovering-a-device-bricked-due-to-ro-verification) on what to do in this case.
