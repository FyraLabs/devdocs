When Accessing Closed Case Debugging, the SuzyQ Board is no different then using any other SuzyQable. Just follow [MrChromebox's WP disabling page](https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/firmware/wp/disabling.html).
If you want to dive deeper, [Google's CCD documentation](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/cr50_stab/docs/case_closed_debugging_gsc.md) is a great resource.
