description: Flash Firmware using the SuzyQ Board
---

When Flashing Firmware, the SuzyQ Board is no different then using a SuzyQable.
Check out [MrChromebox's page on flashing firmware](https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/firmware/manual-flashing.html).

Please note that mrchromebox UEFI only supports x86_64 Chromebooks, but the SuzyQ Board will support any ARM Chromebook that supports CCD.

Note that this WILL work on Ultramarine and Fedora. Grab the `flashrom` package from Fedora repositories, and `cbfstool` from [Terra](https://terra.fyralabs.com/).

For other distros/package manaagers, check out [flashrom packaging on Repology](https://repology.org/project/flashrom/versions), and [cbfstool packaging on Repology](https://repology.org/project/coreboot/versions) (note that the package must include `cbfstool`).
