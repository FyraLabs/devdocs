# Introduction

The SuzyQ Board is an open-source Chromebook debug board sold by Fyra Labs. It is a versatile tool for Chromebook hacking and debugging. This board works exactly like a [Google SuzyQable](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/hdctools/+/master/docs/ccd.md#suzyq-suzyqable). Any guides or documentation you find elsewhere on using 'SuzyQables' will work with the Fyra Labs SuzyQ Board.

Huge shoutout to the [Chrultrabook Project](https://docs.chrultrabook.com/) for their assistance in making this product.
