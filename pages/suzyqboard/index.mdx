# Introduction

The SuzyQ Board is an open-source Chromebook debug board. It's a versatile tool for Chromebook hacking and debugging. This board works exactly like a [Google SuzyQable](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/hdctools/+/master/docs/ccd.md#suzyq-suzyqable). Any guides or documentation you find elsewhere on using 'SuzyQables' will work with the Fyra Labs SuzyQ Board.

Huge shoutout to the [Chrultrabook Project](https://docs.chrultrabook.com/) for their help in building this product.

If you need support with what you're actually doing with the SuzyQ Board, and you're SURE it is not an issue with the board, your question will probably be best answered in the [Chrultrabook Forum](https://forum.chrultrabook.com/).

### What’s With the Case?

The case is to ensure the USB-C connector does not snap off if too much force is applied.
The case is 3D printed, and snaps onto the board with its top and bottom piece.

We HIGHLY RECOMMEND leaving the case on!
However, you can remove it pretty easily by wedging something thin between the top and bottom piece, but again, you SHOULD leave it on!
