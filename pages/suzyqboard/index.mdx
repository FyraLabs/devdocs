# Introduction

The SuzyQ Board is an open-source Chromebook debug board sold by Fyra Labs. It is a versatile tool for Chromebook hacking and debugging. This board works exactly like a [Google SuzyQable](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/hdctools/+/master/docs/ccd.md#suzyq-suzyqable). Any guides or documentation you find elsewhere on using 'SuzyQables' will work with the Fyra Labs SuzyQ Board.

Huge shoutout to the [Chrultrabook Project](https://docs.chrultrabook.com/) for their assistance in making this product.

## FAQ

### Does My Chromebook Support Using a SuzyQ Board?

Please refer to [this list](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/development/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/), if your device supports Closed Case Debugging (CCD), it will support our SuzyQ Board.

### Where Can I Purchase a SuzyQ Board?

You may purchase a SuzyQ Board [on the Fyra Shop](https://fyralabs.com/FDS010).

### Where Are the Schematics?

* [Online schematics view on PCBhub](https://pcbhub.org/projects/53)
* [GitHub repo](https://github.com/FyraLabs/suzyqboard)

### What’s With the Case?

The case is the ensure the USB-C connector does not snap off if too much force is applied.
The case is 3D printed, and snaps onto the board with it's top and bottom piece.

We HIGHLY RECOMMEND leaving the case on!
However, you can remove it pretty easily by wedging something thin between the top and bottom piece, but again, you SHOULD leave it on!
