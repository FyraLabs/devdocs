# Installing

Currently (2022-11-28), Terra only supports RPM packages.

## Adding Terra

You can add Terra into DNF directly:

```sh
$ sudo dnf install --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra$releasever' --setopt='terra.gpgkey=https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra$releasever/key.asc' terra-release
```

<Callout type="info">
  There is also a fancy install script:

{" "}

<Callout type="warning">
  Practice caution before running any commands on your system.
</Callout>

```sh
$ sh <(curl https://terra.fyralabs.com/get.sh)
```

If you doubt the safety of the script (which you should), curl the script to stdout first:

```sh
$ curl https://terra.fyralabs.com/get.sh
```

Or, just don't use the fancy script. I guess.

## Using Terra

### Search

```sh
$ dnf search package-name
(or)
$ dnf provides package-name
```

### Remove

$ sudo dnf remove package-name another-package
```

### Upgrade

```sh
$ sudo dnf upgrade
(or)
$ sudo dnf upgrade package-name another-package
```
