# Installing

Currently (2022-11-28), Terra only supports RPM packages.

## Adding Terra

### Fedora Atomic Editions

On Immutable editions of Fedora, run the following command:

```
curl -fsSL https://github.com/terrapkg/subatomic-repos/raw/main/terra.repo | pkexec tee /etc/yum.repos.d/terra.repo
sudo rpm-ostree install terra-release
```

### Other Fedora Editions

Directly install `terra-release`:

```sh
$ sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra$releasever' terra-release
```

<Callout type="info">
  There is also a fancy install script:

<Callout type="warning">
  Practice caution before running any commands on your system.
</Callout>

```sh
$ sh <(curl https://terra.fyralabs.com/get.sh)
```

If you doubt the safety of the script (which you should), curl the script to stdout first:

```sh
$ curl https://terra.fyralabs.com/get.sh
```

Or, just don't use the fancy script. I guess.

## Using Terra

### Install

```sh
$ sudo dnf install package-name another-package
```

### Search

```sh
$ dnf search package-name
(or)
$ dnf provides package-name
```

### Remove

```sh
$ sudo dnf remove package-name another-package
```

### Upgrade

```sh
$ sudo dnf upgrade
(or)
$ sudo dnf upgrade package-name another-package
```

## Extra Streams

<Callout type="warning">
  Extra streams are designed to provide additional packages that may conflict with your distribution's default packages i.e Fedora.

  If you are not sure what you are doing, it is recommended to not enable the extra streams as it may break your system if not handled properly.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Extra streams are only available for Fedora 41, EL10 (CentOS Stream 10, RHEL 10), and later.
</Callout>

Terra provides extra streams (repositories) for some additional packages. To enable them, run:

```sh
$ sudo dnf install terra-release-extras
```

After installing the extras package, you can then install additional packages that may conflict with Fedora's packages.

Terra contains 2 additional sub-streams included in the extras package:

### Mesa Stream

After installing `terra-release-extras`, you can then enable the Mesa stream:

```sh
$ sudo dnf config-manager setopt terra-mesa.enabled 1
```

### NVIDIA Stream

Terra also provides an additional stream for NVIDIA drivers, based on the [Negativo17](https://negativo17.org/) builds.
To enable the NVIDIA stream, run:

```sh
$ sudo dnf config-manager setopt terra-nvidia.enabled 1
```
