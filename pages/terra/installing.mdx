# Installing

Currently (June 2025), Terra only supports RPM packages.

## Adding Terra

### Fedora and Derivatives

Directly install `terra-release`:

```sh
sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra$releasever' terra-release
```

<Callout type="info">
  There is also a fancy install script:

{" "}

<Callout type="warning">
  Practice caution before running any commands on your system.
</Callout>

```sh
sh <(curl https://terra.fyralabs.com/get.sh)
```

If you doubt the safety of the script (which you should), curl the script to stdout first:

```sh
curl https://terra.fyralabs.com/get.sh
```

Or, just don't use the fancy script. I guess.

</Callout>

#### Ultramarine Linux

Ultramarine already comes with Terra out of the box, simply `dnf` away!

### Fedora Atomic and Derivatives

On Atomic editions of Fedora, run the following command:

```
curl -fsSL https://github.com/terrapkg/subatomic-repos/raw/main/terra.repo | pkexec tee /etc/yum.repos.d/terra.repo
sudo rpm-ostree install terra-release
```

#### Bazzite and Aurora

Bazzite and Aurora come with Terra out of the box, simply `rpm-ostree` away!

#### Bluefin

Bluefin no longer comes with Terra, and disables package layering by default.

To enable layering, edit `/etc/rpm-ostreed.conf` and set `LockLayering` to `false`.

<Callout type="warning">
  Bluefin doesn't officially support this. If you're getting support, make sure
  to mention layering is on.
</Callout>

Then follow the installation instructions for Fedora Atomic.

### Enterprise Linux

Terra EL contains a subset of packages for RHEL 10 and its derivatives.

#### RHEL

Terra EL requires EPEL, which requires CodeReady Builder, let's start by enabling that:

```sh
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-10-$(arch)-rpms
```

Then install EPEL:

```sh
sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-10.noarch.rpm
```

Now you can install Terra!

```sh
sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terrael$releasever' terra-release
```

#### AlmaLinux, CentOS Stream, and RockyLinux

Start by enabling CodeReady Builder:

```sh
sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb
```

Then install `epel-release`

```sh
sudo dnf install epel-release
```

Now you can install Terra!

```sh
sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terrael$releasever' terra-release
```

## Using Terra

### Install

```sh
sudo dnf install package-name another-package
```

### Search

```sh
dnf search package-name
(or)
dnf provides package-name
```

### Remove

```sh
sudo dnf remove package-name another-package
```

### Upgrade

```sh
sudo dnf upgrade
(or)
sudo dnf upgrade package-name another-package
```

## Extra Streams

<Callout type="warning">
  Extra streams are designed to provide additional packages that may conflict with your distribution's default packages i.e Fedora.

If you are not sure what you are doing, it is recommended to not enable the extra streams as it may break your system if not handled properly.

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Extra streams are only available for Fedora 41, EL10 and later.
</Callout>

Terra provides extra streams (repositories) for additional packages. To enable them, run:

```sh
sudo dnf install terra-release-extras
```

After installing the extras package, you can then install additional packages that may conflict with Fedora's packages.

Terra contains 2 additional sub-streams included in the extras package:

### Mesa Stream

After installing `terra-release-extras`, you can then enable the Mesa stream:

```sh
sudo dnf config-manager setopt terra-mesa.enabled=1
```

### NVIDIA Stream

Terra also provides an additional stream for NVIDIA drivers, based on the [Negativo17](https://negativo17.org/) builds.
To enable the NVIDIA stream, run:

```sh
sudo dnf config-manager setopt terra-nvidia.enabled=1
```
