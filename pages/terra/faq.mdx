# FAQ

## Repo Information

### Where is the file server?

https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra39/

or for sources

https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra39-source/

Replace `39` with your Fedora release version.

### What packages does Terra have?

A lot! We have Pantheon packaged (apart from `elementary-tasks`)
and also games, some apps, fonts, and more!

You can search packages via `dnf search` or [Repology].

### Why YET another repository?

- Terra has much more transparency and ease of use/contribution

  - You can see build logs via [Github Actions]
    - NOTE: due to [Github limitations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy), logs are kept for 90 days only
  - The [Andaman] build system and [Subatomic] are fully open sourced

- You can add and manage packages much more easily (See [Contribute](contributing))
- Our autoupdate system ensures that you get the latest packages, with less maintainer burden
- You should see the full introduction at https://terra.fyralabs.com

## Technical details

### What is your Build Infrastructure?

[Andaman]. Packages are built from [Github Actions] and pushed to the repo.

### Why [Andaman]?

Written in rust, it provides an easy and efficient way to manage packages. [Ultramarine Linux] did use Koji, but the complexity makes it harder for us to maintain packages, which is why we decided to create anda.

Anda is responsible for handling autoupdate and building the output artifacts. It supports both `rpmbuild` and `mock`, which couldn't be done using koji.

### What is [Subatomic]?

It manages, uploads, and signs packages.

### Where does the package signing key live, and how is it protected?

[Subatomic] runs on JWT tokens, and only Cappy (one of the maintainers) and the pipeline have them. The secret changes once in a while (and no one has it). The GPG signing key lives separately from the actual repositories.

The repo server is only accessible via HTTPS at https://repos.fyralabs.com/, and is only accessible by system administrators.

### Who has direct access to Terra?

See [team members of `terrapkg`](https://github.com/orgs/terrapkg/people).

### How can I grab the SRPMs?

https://repos.fyralabs.com/terrarawhide-source/

You should be able to grab them by `dnf download --source <pkgname>`
