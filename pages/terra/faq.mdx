# Repo Information

### Where is the file server?

https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra37/

Replace `37` with your Fedora release version.

### What packages does Terra have?

A lot! We have Pantheon packaged (apart from `elementary-tasks`)
and also games, some apps, fonts, and more!

You can search packages via `dnf search` or [Repology].

### Why YET another repository?

- Terra has much more publicity

  - You can see build logs via [Github Actions]
    - NOTE: due to [Github limitations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy), logs are kept for 90 days only
  - The [Andaman] build system and [Subatomic] are fully open sourced

- You can add and manage packages much more easily (See [Contribute](contributing))

# Pantheon

### How can I install Pantheon?

`sudo dnf groupinstall pantheon-desktop`

### Why no `elementary-tasks`?

You can install it via flatpak.

The issue is a bit similar to [#1](../issues/1).
`evolution-data-server` requires both libsoup3-devel and libsoup-devel.
`elementary-tasks` will fail to compile as the compiler sees both libs.
Conflict arises when it is compiled with both libsoup versions.

# Technical details

### What is your Build Infrastructure?

[Andaman]. Packages are built from [Github Actions] and pushed to the repo.

### Why [Andaman]?

Written in rust, it provides an easy and efficient way to manage packages. [Ultramarine Linux] did use Koji, but the complexity makes it harder for us to maintain packages, which is why we decided to create anda.

### What is [Subatomic]?

It manages, uploads, and signs packages.

### Where does the package signing key live, and how is it protected?

[Subatomic] runs on JWT tokens, and only Cappy (one of the maintainers) and the pipeline have them. The secret changes once in a while (and no one has it). The GPG signing key lives on a separate Podman volume from the actual repositories.

The repo server is only accessible via HTTP at https://repos.fyralabs.com/, and SSH is locked to only public keys.

Most of the server infrastructure are locked behind NAT, and only accessible through a Tailscale tailnet. We only expose services when needed using `cloudflared`.

### Who has direct access to Terra?
