# FAQ

## Repo Information

### What packages does Terra have?

A lot! 
We have all necessary [Stardust XR](https://stardustxr.org/) components, various hardware enablement tools, and also games, apps, fonts, and more!

You can search packages via `dnf search` or [Repology].

### Why YET another repository? Why not RPMFusion? Why not COPR?

The main principles that guide Terra are:
- Ease of use, for users, maintainers, distros, and projects.
  - For users, we purposely chose to host the project on a monorepo on GitHub so it's easy to discover, debug, and report issues. In general, we emphasize pragmatism when it improves the user experience.
  - For maintainers, we try to lower the burden required to contribute by:
    - Using common and easily accessible platforms such as GitHub.
    - Heavily documenting our workflow and RPM packaging in general.
    - Using a custom toolchain and set of packaging helpers/macros, that extend on Fedora's.
    - Allowing online builds.
  - For distros, we provide a shared infrastructure that allows them to collaborate with other distros.
    - For example, Bazzite's custom build of mesa, which is hosted on Terra, is co-maintained and used by Ultramarine Linux.
  - For projects, we give an easy path to distribute their software with minimal downstream modifications, near to immediate updates, and less red tape.
    - For example, Terra and Prism Launcher have worked together in order to automatically build and distrbute nightly versions of Prism Launcher, that allows users to test new changes and discover bugs, before they hit a stable release.
    - Another example is with the StardustXR project, which was a largely collaborative effort to bring their software to end-users.
- Automation, which automatically tracks, updates, and backports packages, reducing the time between upstream release and distribution to end-users. Additionally, this reduces a signifigant burdern for maintainers, who have lives too ;p.
- The latest and greatest, which is why Terra offers nightly, preview, and rolling-release packages.

Due to our principles, our goals for Terra are different than the goals of other repositories. Here is a comparison:
- RPMFusion is a great repository, but it doesn't have the level of openness and transparency we're aiming for. Additionally, Terra runs on a rolling release model, which RPMFusion doesn't claim to meet.
  - Of course, these aspects have benefits and trade-offs, rolling release means you get the latest and greatest, but has a level of implied instability. Lowering the bar for contribution allows for more people to contribute more packages, which may be a trade-off in quality. We try to balance these aspects and find a solution we think works best.
- COPR is great for individuals who want to utilize Fedora infrastructure to maintain and package personal repositories.
  - However, this diverges from a major aspect of Terra, which is our shared infrastructure, maintainers, and community. We belive this allows for a more consistent standard of quality and discoverability of packages.

A much more detailed answer can be found from one of our maintainers: https://github.com/terrapkg/packages/issues/6897#issuecomment-3447981771.

### Why do you hate Fedora?

We don't. We maintain a good relationship with the Fedora Project, several maintainers, and other downstreams.
While we may have disagreements of principle with upstream, we still highly value and respect their work, in which Terra would not be possible without.
We do market Terra in a way that some may feel provocative, but our intent is not to denegrate the work of others, but rather differentiate ourselves as a project.

## Technical details

### Where is the file server?

https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra41/

or for sources

https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra41-source/

Replace `41` with your Fedora release version.

### What is your Build Infrastructure?

[Andaman]. x86 packages are built in [Github Actions], while ARM packages are built using a cluster of Mac Minis owned and operated by Fyra Labs. These builds are then pushed to the repo.

### Why [Andaman]?

Written in rust, it provides an easy and efficient way to manage packages. [Ultramarine Linux] did use Koji, but the complexity makes it harder for us to maintain packages, which is why we decided to create anda.

Anda is responsible for handling autoupdate and building the output artifacts. It supports both `rpmbuild` and `mock`, which couldn't be done using koji.

### What is [Subatomic]?

It manages, uploads, and signs packages.

### Where does the package signing key live, and how is it protected?

[Subatomic] runs on JWT tokens, and only Cappy (one of the maintainers) and the pipeline have them. The secret changes once in a while (and no one has it). The GPG signing key lives separately from the actual repositories.

The repo server is only accessible via HTTPS at https://repos.fyralabs.com/, and is only accessible by system administrators.

### Who has direct access to Terra?

See [team members of `terrapkg`](https://github.com/orgs/terrapkg/people).

### How can I grab the SRPMs?

https://repos.fyralabs.com/terrarawhide-source/

You should be able to grab them by `dnf download --source <pkgname>`
