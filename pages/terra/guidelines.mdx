# Terra Guidelines

<Callout type="info">
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
  NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
  "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
  [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) and
  [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174).
</Callout>

Packagers and maintainers MUST follow the policies and guidelines listed in this document.

These are packaging guidelines for Terra. Everything covered here is one of 3 things:

- A difference in the [Fedora Packaging Guidelines]
- In addition to the [Fedora Packaging Guidelines]
- Adding a new guideline

If something seems missing, please refer to the [Fedora Packaging Guidelines].

## Terra Packaging Guidelines

### Packager Field

The package maintainer of a package SHOULD be added to the `Packager:{:rpmspec}` preamble as follows:

```rpmspec
Packager: Raboneko <raboneko@fyralabs.com>
```

### Usages of the `mold` Linker

We encourage the use of [`mold`](https://github.com/rui314/mold), which may speed up build times especially in large projects.
You MAY enable it in C/++ projects by adding `-fuse-ld=mold` in `CFLAGS`/`CXXFLAGS`.

The `%with_mold` flag is enabled by default in `anda-srpm-macros`. `mold` is also preinstalled in the builders.

You can disable `mold` for Rust and Nim by using `%bcond_with mold`.

### Interpreted Languages (Python, Ruby, etc.)

All packages using interpreted languages follow the traditional Fedora guidelines.
All dependencies **_must_** be packaged individually as they are considered runtime dependencies.

### Dynamically Compiled Languages (C, C++, Vala)

Dependencies required for runtime MUST be packaged separately.

### Statically Compiled Languages

As Terra does not strictly follow Fedora's reproducibility requirements, and we do not want large amounts of development libraries for them, packagers SHOULD vendor dependencies on build time.

Terra's mock sandbox has networking enabled, so builders can download the dependencies directly on build time.

#### Rust
These are guidelines for packaging projects written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

For the official Rust language documentation, [see here](https://rust-lang.org/learn).

- You SHOULD add (at least!) the following build dependencies to your spec file:
  - `BuildRequires: anda-srpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
  - `BuildRequires: cargo-rpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
  - `BuildRequires: rust-srpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
- You MAY generate the spec file using `rust2rpm`.
- You SHOULD NOT use the tradtional Fedora `%cargo_prep{:rpmspec}` macro. Instead, use `%cargo_prep_online{:rpmspec}` from `anda-srpm-macros`. Also, you SHOULD remove the `%generate_buildrequires{:rpmspec}` macro, as it is useless.
- It is RECOMMENDED to use `%cargo_license_online{:rpmspec}` and `%cargo_license_summary_online{:rpmspec}`, although they are not a strict requirement.
- You SHOULD NOT use both `%cargo_build{:rpmspec}` and `%cargo_install{:rpmspec}` in the same spec file as anything that calls `cargo install` might cause a rebuild due to a cargo bug. You SHOULD only include `%cargo_build{:rpmspec}` or `%cargo_install{:rpmspec}`. In most cases, you can just omit `%cargo_build{:rpmspec}` entirely and it will build just fine.

Example:

```rpmspec
%prep
%autosetup -n %{crate}-%{version} -p1
%cargo_prep_online

%build
%{cargo_license_online} > LICENSE.dependencies

%install
%cargo_install
```

In some rare cases, you may need to use `%cargo_build{:rpmspec}` and `%crate_install_bin{:rpmspec}` instead:

```rpmspec
%prep
%autosetup -n %{crate}-%{version}
%cargo_prep_online

%build
%{cargo_license_online} > LICENSE.dependencies
%{cargo_build} --locked

%install
# install the binary from target/rpm/%{crate} to %buildroot%_bindir
%crate_install_bin
```

If Rust nightly is required, add the `%rustup_nightly{:rpmspec}` macro to `%prep{:rpmspec}`.

Check the [Rust section on the SRPM page](../terra/srpm#rust) for more information on these macros.

#### Go
These are guidelines for packaging projects written in [Go](https://go.dev).

For the official Go language documentation, [see here](https://go.dev/doc).

- You SHOULD add (at least!) the following build dependencies to your spec file:
  - `BuildRequires: go-rpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
  - `BuildRequires: go-srpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
- If you use `go2rpm`, you SHOULD NOT use the default naming, as an unnecessarily long package name is bad for UX. You MAY put the name generated by `go2rpm` in the `Provides:{:rpmspec}` field.
- You SHOULD remove the `%generate_buildrequires{:rpmspec}` section, and add either add `%global gomodulesmode GO111MODULE=on{:rpmspec}` OR use `%goprep_online{:rpmspec}` instead of `%goprep{:rpmspec}` in the `%prep{:rpmspec}` section. 
  - You SHOULD add `BuildRequires: anda-srpm-macros{:rpmspec}` to your spec if using `%goprep_online{:rpmspec}`.

#### Nim
These are guidelines for packaging projects written in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org).

For the official Nim language documentation, [see here](https://nim-lang.org/documentation.html).

- You SHOULD add (at least!) the following build dependencies to your spec file:
  - `BuildRequires: anda-srpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
  - `BuildRequires: nim{:rpmspec}`
- You SHOULD use our [Nim macros](../terra/srpm#nim).

#### Zig
These are guidelines for packaging projects written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org).

For the official Zig language documentation, [see here](https://ziglang.org/learn).

- You SHOULD add (at least!) the following build dependencies to your spec file:
  - `BuildRequires: zig{:rpmspec}`
  - `BuildRequires: zig-rpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
  - `BuildRequires: zig-srpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
- When building Zig projects you SHOULD keep in mind that Zig is an optimization centric language and some projects may rely on build arguments different than what the [upstream Fedora macros](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/zig/blob/rawhide/f/macros.zig) set. For example, many Zig projects rely on `ReleaseFast` (or more rarely, `ReleaseSmall`) builds for runtime optimization. Additionally, some Zig projects only work correctly when built for certain microarchitectures or higher (usually, this is `x86_64_v2` instead of `baseline` due to reliance on SIMD).
- For these reasons, you SHOULD refer to upstream guidance when packaging Zig projects.
- If any of the scenarios above apply, you MAY use `%zig_build_target` with appropriate flags instead of `%zig_build`. You however SHOULD use `%zig_build` instead if none of the above apply.
  - If using `%zig_build_target`, you SHOULD add `BuildRequires: anda-srpm-macros{:rpmspec}` to your spec.
  - For more information on `%zig_build_target`, please see its documentation on our [macros page](../terra/srpm#zig_build_target).

Regardless of build macro in use, they should be used in either the `%build{:rpmspec}` or `%install{:rpmspec}` section depending on how the project is built (as some can be built directly into root by setting the `DESTDIR=%{buildroot}{:rpmspec}` variable).

Example using `%zig_build`:
```rpmspec
%build
%{zig_build} \
  -Demit-docs
```

Example using `%zig_build_target`:
```rpmspec
%build
%{zig_build_target -r fast -c x86_64_v2} \
  -Demit-docs
```

- Note that `ReleaseFast` and especially `ReleaseSmall` will strip some debug info from the binaries.
- Some Zig projects have enabled build flags to override this and those SHOULD be used if available (this will usually be `-Dstrip=false`).
- If they are not, you may need to disable debug packages using the global variable `%global debug_package %{nil}{:rpmspec}` if not enough debug info is preserved to strip.

For projects where dynamic linking of all dependencies is simply not possible (such as the version in the Fedora repos is too new or too old) or that have no dependencies to link, you MAY use `%zig_build_target` with the `-s` flag. You SHOULD still dynamically link compatible dependencies by using `-fsys=pkgname{:rpmspec}`.

### Shell Completions

- SHOULD be a subpackage.
- SHOULD use the [`%pkg_completion{:rpmspec}` macro](../terra/srpm#pkg_completion).

### Development and Shared Libraries

You SHOULD try to use the [`%pkg_devel_files{:rpmspec}`, `%pkg_libs_files{:rpmspec}` and `%pkg_static_files{:rpmspec}` macros](../terra/srpm#subpackages).

Shared library packages SHOULD be suffixed with `-libs{:rpmspec}`.
These packages SHOULD NOT contain anything **except**:

```rpmspec
%_libdir/*.so.*
%doc …
%license …
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Do not confuse the `-libs` file (`*.so.*`) with a `-devel` file (`*.so`).
</Callout>

Development library packages SHOULD be suffixed with `-devel`.
These packages SHOULD NOT contain anything **except**:

```rpmspec
%doc …
%license …
%_includedir/*
# ^ source files, depending on the language, could be in other locations
%_libdir/*.so
%_libdir/*.a
%_libdir/pkgconfig/%{name}.pc
# and other development files (.vapi, .typelib, .gir, etc.).
```

### Miscellaneous

#### Patches

- A package's `%autosetup{:rpmspec}` macro SHOULD use the `-p1{:rpmspec}` flag only if patches are being applied.
- Packages SHOULD apply patches during `%autosetup{:rpmspec}`. If this is not possible (typically when `%autosetup{:rpmspec}` is not used), you SHOULD use [`%autopatch{:rpmspec}`](../rpm/macros#autopatch).

#### Fixing Packages

- If a package fix PR is fixing/changing anything user-facing, the `Release:{:rpmspec}` tag SHOULD be bumped. The only exception SHOULD be if you are fixing a package where the current version does not and has never built.
  - Some (not all!) examples of user-facing fixes requiring a `Release:{:rpmspec}` bump:
    - Installing a missing file.
    - Adding a package to the `Requires:`.
    - Changing any user-facing tags (`URL:{:rpmspec}`, `License:{:rpmspec}`, `Summary:{:rpmspec}`, etc.).
- If a package fix PR is fixing/changing anything build-facing, the `Release:{:rpmspec}` tag SHOULD NOT need to be bumped.
  - Some (not all!) examples of 'user-facing' fixes requiring a `Release:{:rpmspec}` bump:
    - Adding a package to the `BuildRequires:{:rpmspec}`.
    - Fixing a package that failed to build when the `Version:{:rpmspec}` tag is bumped.
    - Adding/changing new macros, build steps, install steps, or general source code handing during build time (assuming this does not affect the installed files the user will see).
- If you are unsure if a `Release:{:rpmspec}` bump is needed, please open the PR and ask, and we are happy to provide guidance!

#### Usage of Periods in Package Fields
- You MUST NOT have a period at the end of the `Summary:{:rpmspec}` tag, and you SHOULD have a period at the end of all `%description{:rpmspec}` descriptions.

#### Usage of %elifarch

To make specs easier to read, you SHOULD use `%ifarch{:rpmspec}` followed by `%elifarch{:rpmspec}` before `%endif{:rpmspec}` in specs where build steps are arch dependent.

Incorrect:

```rpmspec 
%ifarch x86_64
%define arch %{nil}
%endif
%ifarch aarch64
%define arch arm64-
%endif
```

Correct:

```rpmspec
%ifarch x86_64
%define arch %{nil}
%elifarch aarch64
%define arch arm64-
%endif
```
