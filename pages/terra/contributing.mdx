# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to Terra!

Terra is specifically designed to be as _package-maintainer-friendly_ as possible — you
don't need to know everything about the infrastructure to create a package for Terra!
See the following guide for creating a new package yourself. Quick and easy.

It's also ok to **suggest packages** to include into Terra, though it might take a while. (We're busy!)

Remember, it takes effort to create a package. If you ever need help, hop into
[our Discord server](https://fyralabs.com/discord) and we will try our best to help you.

## Creating a package

### Before you begin...

- Make sure the package name is not taken by other packages in Fedora repositories.
- Review our [packaging policies](policy).
- Review our custom [SRPM macros](#srpm-macros)

### Preparation

#### Fedora/Ultramarine

- Install [Andaman] and its mock configs on your system 
  - `[1;32msudo dnf[97m install [0;97;mterra-mock-configs{:ansi}` via Terra
  - anda is also available via rust crates.io
  - If on an atomic system, this command works using podman: `podman run --rm --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --privileged --volume ./:/anda --volume mock_cache:/var/lib/mock --workdir /anda ghcr.io/terrapkg/builder:frawhide anda`
- Fork the [Terra sources repo](https://github.com/terrapkg/packages), and then `git clone` your fork.
- You are now ready for the [Writing Sources]([contributing#writing-sources](https://developer.fyralabs.com/terra/contributing#writing-sources)) section below.
  
#### Dev Container

You can create, build, and push a package all from within our Dev Container.
This means you do NOT need to be running Fedora/Ultramarine to create a package.
You can run this devcontainer from Linux, macOS, or Windows.

- If you're Visual Studio Code, open it and navigate to the Extensions menu located at the bottom of the left sidebar.
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). If you're on Linux, you'll need to enable the service and reboot.
- Fork the [Terra sources repo](https://github.com/terrapkg/packages), and `git clone` your fork.
- Open this folder in Visual Studio Code (File -> Open Folder).
- It should prompt you to `reopen in Dev Container,` click this and wait for the Dev Container to open. If it doesn't prompt you, press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`, type `Reopen in Container`, and press `Enter`.
- You are now in the Terra Dev Container, and have all the packages and configuration necessary to start building packages!

#### Language Support in Editors

The most common languages you will see:
- RPMSPEC (`.spec`), for the package build scripts
- rhai, for the auto-update scripts
- hcl, for informing `anda` of the package
- xml, for appstream metainfo on some packages

VSCode should prompt you to install these extensions, and Zed should auto-install them.
If not/using a different IDE, we suggest installing language support for each of these.

### Writing sources

1. Fork the [Terra sources repo](https://github.com/terrapkg/packages), and `git clone` your fork.
1. Create a folder named after the package name, for example:
   - A font named `lovelyfonttype` would go in `anda/fonts/lovelyfonttype`.
   - A Pantheon DE package would go in `anda/desktops/elementary/`.
1. Inside the folder, create `anda.hcl` and `<packagename>.spec`.
   - Note that font packages in Fedora repos should end with `-fonts`,
     e.g. the folder name is `lovelyfonttype` but the spec file should be `lovelyfonttype-fonts.spec`.
   - The name of the folder name actually is just for identifications for Terra package maintainers.
     What matters is that the spec file name _must_ match with the package name defined in the spec file later.
     This is a Fedora `mock` limitation.
   - For more information, check out our [packaging policies].
1. Edit `anda.hcl`, which tells [Andaman] how to build the package:

   ```hcl
   project pkg {
       rpm {
           spec = "<packagename>.spec"
       }
   }
   ```

1. Edit the spec file.
   - It is a custom file format for RPM packages.
   - This [RPM Packaging Guide] might help newbies with no prior experiences with RPM specs.
   - This [Spec file format] docs goes into the details of the spec file format.
   - You could use `rust2rpm` for **Rust** packages.
   - You could use `pyp2rpm` for **Python** packages.
   - You could use `go2rpm` for **Go** packages.
   - Otherwise, find the source of the packages you are adding, preferably a URL to a `.tar.gz` archive
   - Multiple archives are ok.
   - Archives not in `.tar.gz` format are also okay, but might require extra work.
   - Archives from git repositories are preferred.

#### Editing the Spec file

> TIP: Check out other spec files of related packages for some examples ;)

A generic spec file looks like this:

```rpmspec
Name:           pkgname
Version:        1.2.3
Release:        1%?dist
Summary:        A package example
URL:            https://example.com
Source0:        https://github.com/some/repo/archive/%{version}.tar.gz
# You should change the above link to the source tarball you got from the preparation section
License:        MIT
BuildRequires:  some dependencies >= 3.2.1 another-dep
Requires:       runtime deps here
# We require you to add yourself as the packager here (if this is an issue for you, let us know):
Packager:       Your Name <meowy@example.com>

%description
This is a description of the package that literally does nothing.

%prep
%autosetup -n name-of-folder-after-source0-expansion
# if you are not using a tarball, simply use normal shell commands to extract the sources
echo "hai"

%build
echo "this will run when building pkg"

%install
echo "this will also run when building pkg but for installing it into %{buildroot} so that anda (mock) can package it"

%files
# This macro expands to `/usr/bin`. To see what macros expand to, you can run `rpm --eval %{MACRO}`
%{_bindir}/pkgname-binary
/path/to/more/files/*/package

%changelog
* Wed Jan 11 2006 your-username-here <your_email@idk.xyz>
- Description on what you've done
```

- Add `Source0` or `Source1` or more.
  These preambles should link to a compressed file (preferably a tarball) and will be extracted during `%prep`.
  You should've had the link prepared during [#Preparation](#preparation) :3
- Add a new line `%prep`
  - The source file will be automatically downloaded and
    extracted with `%autosetup -n <root dir name in tar file>` inside `%prep`.
    Check out `blackbox-terminal.spec` as an example
  - If it is not a tar archive, extract the file manually with a command.
    See `authy.spec` as an example (`unsquashfs`)
- Inside `%build`, you might need to build the package.
  Macros like `%meson` and `%cmake` are supported.
  Check out `blackbox-terminal` or `prismlauncher`
  - if not, manually state the command
- List out all the files to be included inside `%files`
  - Use `%doc` to state the README file (if it exists)
  - Use `%license` to state the COPYING or LICENSE file (if it exists)
  - TIP: If you are unsure about the files to install, run the build first.
    `mock` will show you the files not packaged but installed via an error
- Add `%changelog` (message preferably "Initial Package")

## Building

- Having anda installed (or in the Dev Container) run the following command:

```ansi
[1;32manda[97m build [0;3;37m-c terra-rawhide-x86_64[0m anda/fonts/lovelyfonttype-fonts/pkg
```

If you would like to use the `rpmbuild` mode instead (which will instead not set
up a container), add `--rpm-builder=rpmbuild`. Remember to install the build
dependencies using `[1;32msudo dnf[97m builddep [0;97;mpath/to/pkgname.spec{:ansi}`!

- You don't need to create `pkg`. It's not supposed to exist, just needs to be at the end of the build command
- Modify the architecture to match your machine (`x86_64`, `i386`, `aarch64`)
- If needed (404 errors when building off `rawhide`, you can also modify the version it builds on (`43`, `42`, `el10`, etc.)
- If the package fails to build, fix your spec file accordingly
  - Usually the actual useful error message can be found before the Python traceback (from mock).
- The built RPM(s) will be inside `anda-build/`

## Done?

- Git commit and push; remember you must sign your commits!
- Create a pull request that merges to the `frawhide` branch, this is equivalent to main or master

## Automatic updates

The system regarding automatic updates [are described here](autoupdate). Here is an overview:

[Andaman] supports updating via `.rhai` packages.
See the "book" (more like guide) for [Rhai](https://rhai.rs/book/).

- Create `update.rhai` inside the package folder.
- See references from other packages.
- You also need to add `labels { nightly = "1" }{:hcl}` in `anda.hcl` for nightly packages.

<Callout type="info">Remember to add semicolons in Rhai scripts! (`;`)</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
  Anda defaults the filename to `update.rhai`.
  If it's not `update.rhai`, add a new entry inside `anda.hcl`:
  ```hcl
  project pkg {
    rpm {
      update = "path/to/update.rhai"
      ...
    }
  }
  ```
</Callout>

## SRPM Macros

We provide SPRM macros to ease packaging and better integrate into our workflow. Please use these macros over their counterparts when possible.

These are provided in the `anda-srpm-macros` package, if you use them, make sure to add `anda-srpm-macros` as a `BuildRequires` in the spec file.

Note that the list is not exhaustive, you should always check the [miscellaneous packaging guidelines](./policy#miscellaneous-packaging-guidelines) for more details.

For other macros available in Fedora/Terra, check out our unofficial [macros list](../rpm/macros).

| Macro                           | Function                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `%cargo_prep_online`            | Enables internet access for `cargo`. Replaces `%cargo_prep` in `%prep` |
| `%cargo_license_online`         | Replaces `%cargo_license` in `%build`                                  |
| `%cargo_license_summary_online` | Replaces `%cargo_license_summary` in `%build`                          |
| `%rustup_nightly`               | Uses in `%prep` for nightly `rustc`/`cargo` from `rustup`              |
| `%nim_prep`                     | Setting up `nimble`                                                    |
| `%nim_build` or `%nim_c`        | Builds a package. Requires an argument to `src/pkgname`                |
