# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to Terra!
Terra is specifically designed to be as _package-maintainer-friendly_ as possible -- you
don't need to know everything about the infrastructure to create a package for Terra!
See the following guide for creating a new package yourself. Quick and easy.

It's also ok to **suggest packages** to include into Terra, though it might take a while. (We're busy!)

Remember, it takes effort to create a package. If you ever need help, hop into
[our Discord server](https://discord.gg/5fdPuxTg5Q) and we will try to help you.

## Creating a package

### Before you begin...

- Make sure the package name is not taken by other packages in Fedora repositories.
- Review our [packaging policies](policy).
- Review our custom [SRPM macros](#srpm-macros)

### Preparation

- Install [Andaman] on your system and its mock configs
  - `sudo dnf install anda terra-mock-configs` via Terra
  - anda is also available via rust crates.io
- Use `rust2rpm` for **Rust** packages
- Use `pyp2rpm` for **Python** packages
- Use `go2rpm` for **Go** packages
- else, find the source of the packages you are adding, preferably a URL to a `.tar.gz` archive
  - multiple archives are ok
  - non `.tar.gz` archives are also ok, but might require additional build dependencies
  - we also prefer archives from git repositories

### Writing sources

- Fork/clone the [Terra sources repo](https://github.com/terrapkg/packages)
- Create a folder named after the package name.
  - e.g. you are creating a font package `lovelyfonttype`. Create `anda/fonts/lovelyfonttype`
  - A Pantheon DE package goes into `anda/desktops/elementary/`.
- Inside the folder, create `anda.hcl` and `<packagename>.spec`
  - note: font packages in Fedora repos should end with `-fonts`,
    i.e. the folder name is `lovelyfonttype` but your spec file should be `lovelyfonttype-fonts.spec`
  - The name of the folder name actually is just for identifications for Terra package maintainers.
    What matters is that the spec file name must match with the package name defined in the spec file later.
    This is a Fedora `mock` limitation.
  - For more information, check out our [packaging policies](policy).
- Edit `anda.hcl`, which tells [Andaman] how to build the package:

```hcl
project pkg {
    rpm {
        spec = "<packagename>.spec"
    }
}
```

- Edit the spec file.
  - It is a custom file format for RPM packages.
  - This [RPM Packaging Guide] might help newbies with no prior experiences with RPM specs.
  - This [Spec file format] docs goes into the details of the spec file format.

#### Editing the Spec file

> TIP: Check out other spec files for other packages for some examples ;)

A generic spec file looks like this:

```rpmspec
Name:           pkgname
Version:        1.2.3
Release:        1%?dist
Summary:        A package example
URL:            https://example.com
Source0:        https://github.com/some/repo/archive/%{version}.tar.gz
# You should change the above link to the source tarball you got from the preparation section
License:        MIT
BuildRequires:  some dependencies >= 3.2.1 another-dep
Requires:       deps here
# We *highly* encourage you to add yourself as the packager here:
Packager:       Your Name <meowy@example.com>

%description
This is a description of the package that literally does nothing.

%prep
%autosetup -n name-of-folder-after-source0-expansion
# if you are not using a tarball, simply use normal shell commands to extract the sources
echo "hai"

%build
echo "this will run when building pkg"

%install
echo "this will also run when building pkg but for installing it into %{buildroot} so that anda (mock) can package it"

%files
/usr/bin/pkgname-binary
/path/to/more/files/*/package

%changelog
* Wed Jan 11 2006 your-username-here <your_email@idk.xyz>
- Description on what you've done
```

- Add `Source0` or `Source1` or more.
  These preambles should link to a compressed file (preferably `tar`) and will be extracted during `%prep`
  You should've had the link prepared during [#Preparation](#preparation) :3
- Add a new line `%prep`
  - The source file will be automatically downloaded and
    extracted with `%autosetup -n <root dir name in tar file>` inside `%prep`.
    Check out `blackbox-terminal.spec` as an example
  - If it is not a tar archive, extract the file manually with a command.
    See `authy.spec` as an example (`unsquashfs`)
- Inside `%build`, you might need to build the package.
  Macros like `%meson` and `%cmake` are supported.
  Check out `blackbox-terminal` or `prismlauncher`
  - if not, manually state the command
- List out all the files to be included inside `%files`
  - Use `%doc` to state the README file (if it exists)
  - Use `%license` to state the COPYING or LICENSE file (if it exists)
  - TIP: If you are unsure about the files to install, run the build first.
    `mock` will show you the files not packaged but installed via an error
- Add `%changelog` (message preferably "Initial Package")

## Building

- Having anda installed, run the following command:

```sh
anda build -c terra-rawhide-x86_64 anda/fonts/lovelyfonttype-fonts/pkg
```

If you would like to use the `rpmbuild` mode instead (which will instead not set up a container), add `--rpm-builder=rpmbuild`. Remember to install the build dependencies using `dnf builddep path/to/pkgname.spec`!

- You don't need to create `pkg`. It's not supposed to exist
- Modify the architecture to match your machine
- If the package fails to build, fix your spec file accordingly
  - Usually the actual useful error message can be found before the Python traceback (from mock).
- The built RPM will be inside `anda-build/`

## Done?

- Git commit and push; remember you must sign your commits!
- Create a pull request that merges to the `main` branch

## Automatic updates

The system regarding automatic updates [are described here](autoupdate). Here is an overview:

[Andaman] supports updating via `.rhai` packages.
See the "book" (more like guide) for [Rhai](https://rhai.rs/book/).

- Create `update.rhai` inside the package folder.
- See references from other packages.
- You also need to add `labels { nightly = "1" }` in anda.hcl for nightly packages.

<Callout type="info">Remember to add semicolons in Rhai scripts! (`;`)</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
  Anda defaults the filename to `update.rhai`.
  If it's not `update.rhai`, add a new entry inside `anda.hcl`:
  ```hcl
  project pkg {
    rpm {
      update = "path/to/update.rhai"
      ...
    }
  }
  ```
</Callout>

## SRPM Macros

We provide SPRM macros to ease packaging and better integrate into our workflow. Please use these macros over their counterparts when possible.

These are provided in the `anda-srpm-macros` package, if you use them, make sure to add `anda-srpm-macros` as a `BuildRequires` in the spec file.

| Macro                           | Function                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `%cargo_prep_online`            | Enables internet access for `cargo`. Replaces `%cargo_prep` and should be used in `%prep` |
| `%cargo_license_online`         | Replaces `%cargo_license` in `%build`                                                     |
| `%cargo_license_summary_online` | Replaces `%cargo_license_summary` in `%build`                                             |
