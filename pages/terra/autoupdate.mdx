# Automatic Updates

There have been a few evolutions regarding the ways we deal with automatic updates, with many different solutions being explored in Terra.
Despite how much our automatic package update system evolves, we still
make our best effort to document the latest way to set up automatic updates in Terra. (Seriously!)

## Solutions

### AndaX (Andaman Rhai scripts)

Yes, I know it sounds unusual, but `.rhai` scripts are used to update packages in Terra. You can check out the [Rhai] documentations.
Put your Rhai script in `update.rhai` next to the corresponding `anda.hcl` file. Andaman will detect it automatically.

```ts
// An example of AndaX update script.
let ver = gh("FyraLabs/subatomic"); // gets latest version from GitHub
rpm.version(ver); // updates the version in the spec file using `ver`
```

<Callout type="warning">you need SEMICOLONS! (`;`)</Callout>

Updates are triggered every 10 minutes using `[1;32manda[97m update{:ansi}`.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ“”">
  Actually, the [full command](https://github.com/terrapkg/packages/blob/4767e5b9560f2986accaeb8447fbb4ea742041cf/.github/workflows/update.yml#L27-L31)
  for auto-updating normal packages is: (as of 2024-08-09)
  ```sh
  RUST_BACKTRACE=full GITHUB_TOKEN=... anda update -vv --excludes nightly=1 --excludes updbranch=1
  ```
</Callout>

#### Nightly packages

Nightly packages are updated every 24 hours using
`[1;32manda[97m update [0;3;37m-vv --filters[0;97;m nightly=1{:ansi}`.
Their `anda.hcl` files should look something like this:

```hcl
project pkg {
	rpm {
		spec = "pkg.spec"
	}
	labels {
		nightly = 1
	}
}
```

#### Per-branch auto-update scripts

Terra supports updating a package for specific branches instead of updating a package for all branches.
This is achieved using `[0;3;37m--filters[0;97;m updbranch=1 [0;3;37m--labels[0;97;m branch=f41{:ansi}` (`f41` is replaced by the branch name).
The update command is run every 30 minutes.

The `anda.hcl` file should look like this:

```hcl
project pkg {
  rpm {
    spec = "pkg.spec"
  }
  labels {
    updbranch = 1
  }
}
```

You can obtain the branch name during runtime in Rhai using `labels.branch` (string).

<Callout type="error">
  You MUST NOT use this feature if the script ends up bumping versions across all branches at the same time.
  This feature should only be used under cases where the version is different for different branch but for the same package.

  Consequently, under normal circumstances and without approval, you are NOT allowed to use GitHub/GitLab related functions.
</Callout>

#### Weekly packages

Weekly packages are updated every 7 days using
`[1;32manda[97m update [0;3;37m-vv --filters[0;97;m weekly=[1;35m$([1;32mdate [1;36m"+%w"[1;35m){:ansi}`.
Their `anda.hcl` files should look something like this:

```hcl
project pkg {
	rpm {
		spec = "pkg.spec"
	}
	labels {
		weekly = 0 # a random number between 0~6 inclusive
	}
}
```

To decide the random number, just search for "_random number between 0 and 6_" with your favourite search engine.
The random number decides which day in the week will the auto-update script run.

#### Functions and Modules

In most cases, `rpm.version(gh("..."));{:ts}` as a one-liner is enough to make it workâ„¢.
Documentations for more functions are available in the [Andaman
devdocs](/andaman/andax#custom-functions).

Other functions are available in the `andax/` directory after `import{:ts}`ing.

### HeadPAT

[HeadPAT] is a work-in-progress package version tracker. It is (going to be) a self-hosted microservice.

#### Planned usage

Just like `update.rhai` scripts, a `.pat` file will be used with the following format:

```
ver gh FyraLabs/anda
```

That's it.

However, we are exploring the posibility of adding Lua into the mix to make things more extensible:

```
lua
```

Then HeadPAT will look for `pat.lua` in the same directory.
However, it is uncertain if the above will be the actual format as HeadPAT is still under heavy (but slow) development.

## Guidelines

<Callout type="warning">
  Avoid using the <span title="This includes gh() and gh_tag()">GitHub API</span> for fetching the latest versions.
  You may use GitLab, crates.io, Pypi, etc. instead.
  This is because GitHub has an API rate-limit.
</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
  You might see scripts with `if filters.contains("nightly")`. This `if` statement is no longer needed.
</Callout>
<Callout type="warning">Avoid running code unrelated to updating/bumping packages.</Callout>
