# Content List

![](/images/helium/hig/content_list.png)

A Content List is a grouping of Content Blocks that share the same purpose, and have an optional header that uses the Heading Typography class, and a description that uses Body Typography class.

- The Content List is a perfect place to add a header and description if it's needed above the elements that constitute it.
- Do not clutter the UI with too many Content Lists, prefer to limit to 4 per view.
