# App Branding

Crafting a solid app branding is crucial in the world of apps.

It goes beyond just visual elements like shapes and colors â€“ it's about creating
a distinct identity. In a crowded space of various apps, having a well-defined brand
helps communicate what your app is all about and sets it apart. Consistency in branding,
from the app icon to other materials, contributes to a seamless user experience
and strengthens brand recognition.

This strategic approach not only builds user trust but also plays a key role in retaining
users by creating a sense of familiarity and loyalty. So, thoughtful app branding is not
just about looks; it's a strategic move to navigate the dynamic landscape of app design
and leave a lasting impression on the people using it.

## Adding brand colors

Apps are expected to provide two different brand colors for light and dark.
This is the snippet you need to include in your MetaInfo/AppData file:

```xml
<branding>
  <color type="primary" scheme_preference="light">#faa298</color>
  <color type="primary" scheme_preference="dark">#7f2c22</color>
</branding>
```

When selecting colors, ensure they suit their context (avoid light yellow for dark themes)
and complement the app icon. For light schemes, opt for a lighter tint of the main icon color;
for dark schemes, choose a darker shade or a complementary color that harmonizes with the
icon's colors. This maintains contrast and enhances visual appeal.
