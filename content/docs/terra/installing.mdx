## Adding Terra

### Fedora and Derivatives

Directly install `terra-release`:

```sh
sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra$releasever' terra-release
```

<Callout type="info">
  There is also a fancy install script:

{" "}

<Callout type="warning">
  Practice caution before running any commands on your system.
</Callout>

```sh
sh <(curl https://terra.fyralabs.com/get.sh)
```

If you doubt the safety of the script (which you should), curl the script to stdout first:

```sh
curl https://terra.fyralabs.com/get.sh
```

Or, just don't use the fancy script. I guess.

</Callout>

#### Ultramarine Linux

Ultramarine already comes with Terra out of the box, simply `dnf` away!

### Fedora Atomic and Derivatives

On Atomic editions of Fedora, run the following command:

```
curl -fsSL https://github.com/terrapkg/subatomic-repos/raw/main/terra.repo | pkexec tee /etc/yum.repos.d/terra.repo
sudo rpm-ostree install terra-release
```

#### Bazzite and Aurora

Bazzite and Aurora come with Terra out of the box, simply `rpm-ostree` away!

#### Bluefin

Bluefin no longer comes with Terra, and disables package layering by default.

To enable layering, edit `/etc/rpm-ostreed.conf` and set `LockLayering` to `false`.

<Callout type="warning">
  Bluefin doesn't officially support this. If you're getting support, make sure
  to mention layering is on.
</Callout>

Then follow the installation instructions for Fedora Atomic.

### Enterprise Linux

Terra EL contains a subset of packages for RHEL 10 and its derivatives.

#### RHEL

Terra EL requires EPEL, which requires CodeReady Builder, let's start by enabling that:

```sh
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-10-$(arch)-rpms
```

Then install EPEL:

```sh
sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-10.noarch.rpm
```

Now you can install Terra!

```sh
sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terrael$releasever' terra-release
```

#### AlmaLinux, CentOS Stream, and RockyLinux

Start by enabling CodeReady Builder:

```sh
sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb
```

Then install `epel-release`

```sh
sudo dnf install epel-release
```

Now you can install Terra!

```sh
sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terrael$releasever' terra-release
```

## Subrepos

<Callout type="info">Subrepos are not available on Enterprise Linux.</Callout>

Terra provides additional packages in separate repositories. These packages might conflict with RPM Fusion or the Fedora repositories. Extra care and technical knowledge may be needed.

The current list of subrepos are `extras`, `nvidia`, `mesa`, `multimedia` (f43+ only).
They can be enabled by installing `terra-release-extras`, `terra-release-nvidia`, etc.

### Extras

The extras subrepo provides miscellaneous packages that conflict with Fedora. Things like patched WINE and Switcheroo control are in Extras.

### Mesa

The Mesa subrepo provides our build of Mesa, with patches from our friends at Universal Blue and most features enabled, unlike RPMFusion and Fedora's builds.

### NVIDIA

The NVIDIA subrepo provides a selection of drivers and software for NVIDIA GPUs. We offer drivers based on [Negativo17](https://negativo17.org/) builds, and CUDA packages.

### Multimedia

The multimedia subrepo is only available on Fedora 43 and newer. It provides multimedia codecs and related software, like `gstreamer1` packages and `ffmpeg`.
