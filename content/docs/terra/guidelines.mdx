## Overview

<Callout type="info">
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
  NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
  "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
  [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) and
  [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174).
</Callout>

Packagers and maintainers MUST follow the policies and guidelines listed in this document.
Everything covered here is one of 3 things:

- Differences from the [Fedora Packaging Guidelines]
- Changes in addition to the [Fedora Packaging Guidelines]
- Terra-exclusive guidelines

It is highly recommended to read through the [Fedora Packaging Guidelines] on langauges/sections not listed here, or for greater detail.

## TL;DR

Condensed version of guidelines.

<Callout type="warning">
  REMEMBER TO [BUMP](#fixing-packages) `Release:{:rpmspec}` if propose new changes (unless pkg with current release num doesn't exist in [repos](https://repos.fyralabs.com/))
</Callout>

No period at end of `Summary:{:rpmspec}`, but add period at end of `%description{:rpmspec}`.
[`%changelog`](/terra/guidelines#fixing-packages) only for large changes.
Prefer patching e.g. `-p1` at `%autosetup` over using `%autopatch`.
Prefer `%elifarch` over `%endif` + `%ifarch`.

Use [`%pkg_completion`](/terra/srpm#pkg_completion) for shell completions.
Use [`%pkg_devel_files`](/terra/srpm#pkg_devel_files), [`%pkg_libs_files`](/terra/srpm#pkg_libs_files), [`%pkg_static_files`](/terra/srpm#pkg_static_files).
See [Development and Shared Libraries](/terra/guidelines#development-and-shared-libraries) section.

Install `.desktop` file to `%_appsdir` for graphical apps. [Guide here](/terra/guidelines#providing-your-own-desktop-file).
Prefer upstream provided ones over manually generating one.
Use [`%desktop_file_install`](/terra/srpm#desktop_file_install) / [`%desktop_file_validate`](/terra/srpm/#desktop_file_validate).
See [our macros](/terra/srpm#desktop-file-macros).

Follow Fedora guidelines for interpreted (ex. Python/Ruby) & dynamically (ex. C/++) compiled langs.
Statically compiled lang guidelines follow.

For [Rust](#rust), use `rust2rpm`, suffix `_online` to `%cargo_prep`, `%cargo_license`, `%cargo_license_summary`;
remove `%generate_buildrequires{:rpmspec}` section.
If no flags to `%cargo_build`, remove it,
else add flags to it and replace `%cargo_install` with `%crate_install_bin`.
Also `%rustup_nightly` exists btw, [see our macros](../terra/srpm#rust).

For [Go](#go), use `go2rpm`, rename package name to sensible one,
remove `%generate_buildrequires{:rpmspec}` section, 
EITHER add `%global gomodulesmode GO111MODULE=on{:rpmspec}` OR replace `%goprep` with [`%goprep_online`](/terra/srpm#goprep_online).

For [Nim](#nim), use one of below. Also `%nim_c` = `%nim_build`, [see our macros](/terra/srpm#nim).

<Split.Root>
  <div>
    ```rpmspec
    %prep
    %autosetup
    %nim_prep

    %build
    %nim_c src/dive
    ```
  </div>
  <div>
    ```rpmspec
    %prep
    %autosetup -Sgit

    %build
    atlas init
    atlas rep atlas.lock
    %nim_c src/netto
    ```
  </div>
</Split.Root>

For [Zig](#zig), `BuildRequires: zig zig-rpm-macros zig-srpm-macros{:rpmspec}`.
If doesn't build with build arguments provided by Fedora `%zig_build`
(e.g. `ReleaseFast` required, microarchitectures), try [`%zig_build_target`](#zig_build_target).
Remember to try e.g. `-Dstrip=false`. If still no debug info, `%global debug_package %{nil}{:rpmspec}`.
If can't dynamically link all deps / no deps to link, `%zig_build_target` with `-s`, then `-fsys=pkgname` for things dyn-linkable.

## Terra Packaging Guidelines

### Usage of the `mold` Linker

We encourage the use of [`mold`](https://github.com/rui314/mold), which can speed up build times, especially in large projects.
You MAY enable it in C/++ projects by adding `-fuse-ld=mold` in `CFLAGS`/`CXXFLAGS`.

The `%with_mold` flag is enabled by default in `anda-srpm-macros`. `mold` is also preinstalled in the builders.

You can disable `mold` for Rust and Nim by using `%bcond_with mold`.

### Interpreted Languages (Python, Ruby, etc.)

All packages using interpreted languages SHOULD follow the Fedora guidelines.
All dependencies **_must_** be packaged individually as they are considered runtime dependencies.

### Dynamically Compiled Languages (C, C++, Vala)

Dependencies required for runtime MUST be packaged separately.

### Statically Compiled Languages

Terra does not strictly follow Fedora's reproducibility requirements, and we do not want large amounts of development libraries for them, packagers SHOULD vendor dependencies on build time.

Terra's Mock sandbox has networking enabled, so builders can download the dependencies directly on build time.

#### Rust
These are guidelines for packaging projects written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

For the official Rust language documentation, [see here](https://rust-lang.org/learn).

- You SHOULD add (at least!) the following build dependencies to your spec file:
  - `BuildRequires: anda-srpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
  - `BuildRequires: cargo-rpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
  - `BuildRequires: rust-srpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
- You MAY generate the spec file using `rust2rpm`.
- You SHOULD NOT use the tradtional Fedora `%cargo_prep{:rpmspec}` macro. Instead, use `%cargo_prep_online{:rpmspec}` from `anda-srpm-macros`. Also, you SHOULD remove the `%generate_buildrequires{:rpmspec}` macro, as it is useless.
- It is RECOMMENDED to use `%cargo_license_online{:rpmspec}` and `%cargo_license_summary_online{:rpmspec}`, although they are not a strict requirement.
- You SHOULD NOT use both `%cargo_build{:rpmspec}` and `%cargo_install{:rpmspec}` in the same spec file as anything that calls `cargo install` might cause a rebuild due to a cargo bug. You SHOULD only include `%cargo_build{:rpmspec}` or `%cargo_install{:rpmspec}`. In most cases, you can just omit `%cargo_build{:rpmspec}` entirely and it will build just fine.

Example:

```rpmspec
%prep
%autosetup -n %{crate}-%{version} -p1
%cargo_prep_online

%build
%{cargo_license_online} > LICENSE.dependencies

%install
%cargo_install
```

In rare cases, you may need to use `%cargo_build{:rpmspec}` and `%crate_install_bin{:rpmspec}` instead:

```rpmspec
%prep
%autosetup -n %{crate}-%{version}
%cargo_prep_online

%build
%{cargo_license_online} > LICENSE.dependencies
%{cargo_build} --locked

%install
# install the binary from target/rpm/%{crate} to %buildroot%_bindir
%crate_install_bin
```

If Rust nightly is required, add the `%rustup_nightly{:rpmspec}` macro to `%prep{:rpmspec}`.

Check the [Rust section on the SRPM page](../terra/srpm#rust) for more information on these macros.

#### Go
These are guidelines for packaging projects written in [Go](https://go.dev).

For the official Go language documentation, [see here](https://go.dev/doc).

- You SHOULD add (at least!) the following build dependencies to your spec file:
  - `BuildRequires: go-rpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
  - `BuildRequires: go-srpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
- If you use `go2rpm`, you SHOULD NOT use the default naming, as an unnecessarily long package name is bad for UX. You MAY put the name generated by `go2rpm` in the `Provides:{:rpmspec}` field.
- You SHOULD remove the `%generate_buildrequires{:rpmspec}` section, and either add `%global gomodulesmode GO111MODULE=on{:rpmspec}` OR use `%goprep_online{:rpmspec}` instead of `%goprep{:rpmspec}` in the `%prep{:rpmspec}` section. 
  - You SHOULD add `BuildRequires: anda-srpm-macros{:rpmspec}` to your spec if using `%goprep_online{:rpmspec}`.

#### Nim
These are guidelines for packaging projects written in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org).

For the official Nim language documentation, [see here](https://nim-lang.org/documentation.html).

- You SHOULD add (at least!) the following build dependencies to your spec file:
  - `BuildRequires: anda-srpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
  - `BuildRequires: nim{:rpmspec}`
- You SHOULD use our [Nim macros](../terra/srpm#nim).

In most cases, use `nimble` to download dependencies in `%prep{:rpmspec}`,
then `%build{:rpmspec}` with `nim`, e.g.[^1]:

```rpmspec
%prep
%autosetup
%nim_prep

%build
%nim_c src/dive

%install
install -Dm755 src/dive -t %buildroot%_bindir
```

The use of the [`atlas`](https://github.com/nim-lang/atlas) package cloner is also recognized, e.g.[^2]:

```rpmspec
%prep
%autosetup -Sgit

%build
atlas init
atlas rep atlas.lock
%nim_c src/netto
```

#### Zig
These are guidelines for packaging projects written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org).

For the official Zig language documentation, [see here](https://ziglang.org/learn).

- You SHOULD add (at least!) the following build dependencies to your spec file:
  - `BuildRequires: zig{:rpmspec}`
  - `BuildRequires: zig-rpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
  - `BuildRequires: zig-srpm-macros{:rpmspec}`
- When building Zig projects you SHOULD keep in mind that Zig is an optimization centric language and some projects may rely on build arguments different than what the [upstream Fedora macros](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/zig/blob/rawhide/f/macros.zig) set. For example, many Zig projects rely on `ReleaseFast` (or more rarely, `ReleaseSmall`) builds for runtime optimization. Additionally, some Zig projects only work correctly when built for certain microarchitectures or higher (usually, this is `x86_64_v2` instead of `baseline` due to reliance on SIMD).
- For these reasons, you SHOULD refer to upstream guidance when packaging Zig projects.
- If any of the scenarios above apply, you MAY use `%zig_build_target` with appropriate flags instead of `%zig_build`. You however SHOULD use `%zig_build` instead if none of the above apply.
  - If using `%zig_build_target`, you SHOULD add `BuildRequires: anda-srpm-macros{:rpmspec}` to your spec.
  - For more information on `%zig_build_target`, please see its documentation on our [macros page](/terra/srpm#zig_build_target).

Regardless of build macro in use, they should be used in either the `%build{:rpmspec}` or `%install{:rpmspec}` section depending on how the project is built (as some can be built directly into root by setting the `DESTDIR=%{buildroot}{:rpmspec}` variable).

Example using `%zig_build`:
```rpmspec
%build
%{zig_build} \
  -Demit-docs
```

Example using `%zig_build_target`:
```rpmspec
%build
%{zig_build_target -r fast -cx86_64_v2} \
  -Demit-docs
```

- Note that `ReleaseFast` and especially `ReleaseSmall` will strip some debug info from the binaries.
- Some Zig projects have enabled build flags to override this and those SHOULD be used if available (this will usually be `-Dstrip=false`).
- If they are not, you may need to disable debug packages using the global variable `%global debug_package %{nil}{:rpmspec}` if not enough debug info is preserved to strip.

For projects where dynamic linking of all dependencies is simply not possible (such as the version in the Fedora repos is too new or too old) or that have no dependencies to link, you MAY use `%zig_build_target` with the `-s` flag. You SHOULD still dynamically link compatible dependencies by using `-fsys=pkgname{:rpmspec}`.

### Shell Completions

- SHOULD be a subpackage.
- SHOULD use the [`%pkg_completion` macro](../terra/srpm#pkg_completion).

### Development and Shared Libraries

You SHOULD try to use the [`%pkg_devel_files`, `%pkg_libs_files` and `%pkg_static_files` macros](/terra/srpm#subpackages).

Shared library packages SHOULD be suffixed with `-libs{:rpmspec}`.
These packages SHOULD NOT contain anything **except**:

```rpmspec
%_libdir/*.so.*
%doc …
%license …
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Do not confuse the `-libs` file (`*.so.*`) with a `-devel` file (`*.so`).
</Callout>

Development library packages SHOULD be suffixed with `-devel`.
These packages SHOULD NOT contain anything **except**:

```rpmspec
%doc …
%license …
%_includedir/*
# ^ source files, depending on the language, could be in other locations
%_libdir/*.so
%_libdir/*.a
%_libdir/pkgconfig/%{name}.pc
# and other development files (.vapi, .typelib, .gir, etc.).
```
### JavaScript
These are guidelines for packaging projects written in or which utilize [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

These guidelines also often cover things written in or which utilize [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

#### Node Modules
Guidelines for packaging Node modules in Terra.

<Callout type="info">
  "Node modules" in this document refers to JavaScript packages run using a JavaScript runtime (usually Node.js), which are hosted on the [NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.com).<br />
  "JavaScript modules," however, refers to JavaScript packages run using a JavaScript runtime which are hosted on *either* the NPM Registry or the [JavaScript Registry](https://jsr.io), the latter of which are also called "modern JavaScript packages." This means Node modules are JavaScript modules, but not the other way around.<br />
  NPM only officially uses Node modules. You can use JSR with NPX by using `npx jsr`, but not through NPM directly. Other package managers of new enough versions support both.
</Callout>

- You SHOULD add (at least!) the following build dependencies to your spec file:
  - `BuildRequires: nodejs{:rpmspec}` (OR the required Node.js version if the default in a given branch of Fedora will not work)
    - If using an alternate Node.js version be prepared that you may need to patch or otherwise edit some JS executables' shebangs.
  - `BuildRequires: nodejs-npm{:rpmspec}`
  - `BuildRequires: nodejs-packaging{:rpmspec}`
- We package them like Arch and other distros, and allow bundled dependencies unlike Fedora. You however MAY use system dependencies instead for modules by removing the installed dependency and symlinking it to the one available in the package repos, but this is likely more work than it is worth.
- You MUST either set `%global npm_name pkgname{:rpmspec}` or use `%npm_prep -n pkgname{:rpmspec}` when packaging Node modules directly. This MUST be defined as the canonical name of the module as listed on the NPM Registry.
- You SHOULD use `%npm_license` to create the license of the bundled dependencies.
- You MAY opt instead to follow Fedora's Node.js packaging methods but keep in mind this is very difficult to maintain and may not work on all modules.

### Web Applications
These are guidelines for building [web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) (hereafter referred to as "webapps"), which refers to apps built using technologies such as Electron or Tauri.

These apps embed parts of browser functionality in order to display web content. One of the most recognizable examples is [Discord](https://discord.com).

The general guidelines for building webapps are:
- Use our [JavaScript package manager macros](/terra/srpm#javascript-package-managers) and/or [webapp build macros](/terra/srpm#webapp-build-macros).
- Use appropriate [Electron macros](/terra/srpm#electron) for Electron apps.
- Use appropriate [Tauri macros](/terra/srpm#tauri) for Tauri apps.
- Add the correct JavaScript package manager to your build dependencies.
  - Examples:
  - ```rpmspec
    BuildRequires: bun-bin
    BuildRequires: deno
    BuildRequires: pnpm
    BuildRequires: yarnpkg
    ```

/>

#### Electron
These are guidelines for packaging [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) apps.

<Callout type="idea">
  Many Electron projects will default to building distro binary packages (such as RPMs and Debs) and this rarely works well in RPM builds. Packagers should be prepared to patch or otherwise modify the Electron Builder config to rectify this.
</Callout>

- You SHOULD add `%electronmeta` and make sure it is in the correct location in the spec file. The other macros for Electron also depend on the information in this being set.
  - This meta macro automatically handles MANY common issues that can happen with Electron packages including incorrect dependencies due to bundled (or private) [shared object (`*.so`) libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_library).
  - It also pulls all basic build dependencies for Electron apps.
  - Like all meta macros, must be placed carefully:
    - MUST always come after `Name:{:rpmspec}` is defined and before the first `%description{:rpmspec}`.
    - SHOULD come before the `License:{:rpmspec}` field if using [`%{electron_license}`](#electron_license).
    - MAY be used under preambles but before `%description{:rpmspec}` if not using `%{electron_license}{:rpmspec}`.
    - For more information on what all this meta macro does, please read [its section in our SRPM documentation page](/terra/srpm#electronmeta).
- You SHOULD append any additional private (bundled) libraries that the Electron app has that are picked up by RPM [AutoReqProv](http://ftp.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-rpm-depend-auto-depend.html) to `%{__requires_excludes}` and `%{__provides_excludes}` using a `%global{:rpmspec}` similar to the below examples.
  - `%global __requires_excludes %{__requires_excludes}|private_library\\.so{:rpmspec}`
  - `%global __provides_excludes %{__provides_excludes}|private_library\\.so{:rpmspec}`
- You MAY use the macro `%{electron_license}` which contains the licenses for bundled Electron. You SHOULD double check any additional licenses you should list and make sure any other listed licenses are not duplicated or overlapping.
  - You can double check what the macro expands to with the command `rpm --eval '%{electron_license}'{:sh}` if you have `anda-srpm-macros` installed.
- You SHOULD use our [`%electron_install` macro](/terra/srpm#electron_install) for installing Electron apps.

#### Tauri
These are guidelines for packaging [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app) apps.

Tauri builds webapps using Cargo and the system WebKit. For these reasons some of the [Rust](#rust) guidelines also apply to Tauri. Most relevant Cargo macros have been ported into Tauri compatible ones, however it will likely still be helpful to make yourself familiar with the original macros.
<Callout type="idea">
  It is important to note that unlike the original Cargo macros, Tauri macros only support passing features with the `-f` flag due to how Tauri works.
</Callout>

- You SHOULD use one of the following in your spec:
  - `BuildRequires: %{tauri_buildrequires}{:rpmspec}`
  - ```rpmspec
    %generate_buildrequires
    %tauri_generate_buildrequires
    ```
  <Callout type="warning">
    BuildRequires generation only works in Mock.
  </Callout>
- You SHOULD use `%tauri_prep{:rpmspec}` in the `%prep{:rpmspec}` section.
- You SHOULD use either a [webapp build macro](/terra/srpm#webapp-build-macros) or the [`%tauri_build` macro](/terra/srpm#tauri_build), however the latter will not work with *all* Tauri projects. See its entry on our SRPM macros page for more information.
- You SHOULD use `%{tauri_cargo_license} > LICENSE.dependencies` in your spec to package the Cargo dependency licenses.
- You MAY use the `%tauri_cargo_license_summary` and `%tauri_cargo_vendor_manifest` macros in your spec for addition license and Cargo information.
- You MAY use the [configurable macros for Tauri builds](/terra/srpm#configurable-tauri-macros) if necessary, but it should rarely be needed.

### Miscellaneous

#### Changelog Entries

You MUST add a Changelog entry when you submit a new package, and you MUST NOT use `%autochangelog`.
We typically use `Initial package`/`Initial commit`, but anything that describes adding the package is fine.

##### Changing an Existing Package

You SHOULD add a `%changelog{:rpmspec}` entry for large changes, such as file renames, new build process, etc.
Small changes like adding build dependencies or adding one-liners to make a build work MAY be omitted from adding a `%changelog{:rpmspec}` entry, it is up to you.

##### Copying a Spec from a Different Repository

When copying/porting/using a spec file from a different repository (SUSE, Mandriva, RPMfusion, Copr, etc.), you MUST preserve any changelogs in the spec, and then add your own changelog entry as `Port to Terra`.
You MAY specify which repo it has been ported from.

##### Modifying Changelog Entries

This *should* not need to be done, the only reasons are if there was a formatting error, date error, or updated name/emails.
It is also acceptable to add more to previous changelogs (for example, adding missing emails/version), but there has to be a reason to do this.

#### Fixing Packages

- If a PR is changing anything user-facing, the `Release:{:rpmspec}` tag SHOULD be bumped. The only exception SHOULD be if you are fixing a package where the current version does not and has never built.
  - Some (not all!) examples of user-facing fixes requiring a `Release:{:rpmspec}` bump:
    - Installing a missing file.
    - Adding any build or non-build, hard or soft, forward or backward dependencies.
    - Changing any user-facing tags (`URL:{:rpmspec}`, `License:{:rpmspec}`, `Summary:{:rpmspec}`, etc.).
- If a package fix PR is *not* fixing/changing anything build-facing, the `Release:{:rpmspec}` tag SHOULD NOT need to be bumped.
  - Some (not all!) examples of changes which don't require a `Release:{:rpmspec}` bump:
    - Fixing a package that failed to build when the `Version:{:rpmspec}` tag is bumped.
    - Any changes that do not affect the final package.
- If you are unsure if a bump is needed, bump it.
- Follow appropriate changelog procedures outlined in the above section.

#### Patches

- Packages SHOULD apply patches (usually via the `-p#` flag) in `%autosetup{:rpmspec}`. If this is not possible (typically when `%autosetup{:rpmspec}` is not used), you SHOULD use [%autopatch](../rpm/macros#autopatch).

#### Providing Your Own .desktop File

If you are packaging a graphical app that doesn't provide its own `.desktop` file, you SHOULD create one.

##### Creating the .desktop File

Copy the following template:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=PACKAGE NAME
Exec=PROVIDED_BINARY
Icon=ICON NAME
Type=Application
```

The `Icon` tag SHOULD NOT a contain full path, just the name of the icon file without the file extension.
The `Exec` tag SHOULD be a full path if the binary placed in `/usr/bin` is a symlink.
If this is not the case, it is up to you if you want to use the full path or not (it will look in the user's `$PATH`).

You SHOULD name this file either `package-name.desktop` or `package_app-ID.desktop`.
You MAY add more tags, to see all possible tags, read through the [freedesktop specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry/latest/).

##### Installing the .desktop File

To install the `.desktop` file:

1. Add it to your package's folder
2. Add it as a `Source:{:rpmspec}` in the .spec file
3. Install it
4. List it in the `%files{:rpmspec}` section

It is RECOMMENDED to use the [`%_appsdir` macro](/terra/srpm#_appsdir) instead of `%_datadir/applications/`, and to use the [`%desktop_file_install` macro](/terra/srpm#desktop_file_install).
With [NeoHtop package] as the example:

```rpmspec
Source1:  NeoHtop.desktop

...

%install
%desktop_file_install %{SOURCE1} %{buildroot}%{_appsdir}/NeoHtop.desktop

...

%files
...
%{_appsdir}/NeoHtop.desktop
```

##### Validating the .desktop File

You MUST validate your `.desktop` file. To do this, add the following to your spec file:

```rpmspec
BuildRequires:  desktop-file-utils

...

%check
%desktop_file_validate %{buildroot}%{_appsdir}/NeoHtop.desktop

...
```

##### Finished Example

`NeoHtop.desktop`:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Categories=Utility;
Comment=A cross-platform system monitor
Exec=NeoHtop
Icon=NeoHtop
Name=NeoHtop
Terminal=false
Type=Application
```

All custom `.desktop` file portions of a spec file:

```rpmspec
Source1:  NeoHtop.desktop

...

BuildRequires:  desktop-file-utils

%install
...
%desktop_file_install %{SOURCE1}

%check
%desktop_file_validate %{buildroot}%{_appsdir}/NeoHtop.desktop

%files
...
%{_appsdir}/NeoHtop.desktop
```

#### Usage of Periods in Various Package Fields
You MUST NOT have a period at the end of any `Summary:{:rpmspec}` tags, and you SHOULD have a period at the end of all `%description{:rpmspec}`s.

#### Usage of %elifarch

To make specs easier to read, you SHOULD use `%ifarch{:rpmspec}` followed by `%elifarch{:rpmspec}` before `%endif{:rpmspec}` in specs where build steps are arch dependent.

<Callout title="Incorrect:" type="error">
```rpmspec 
%ifarch x86_64
%define arch %{nil}
%endif
%ifarch aarch64
%define arch arm64-
%endif
```
</Callout>

<Callout title="Correct:" type="success">

```rpmspec
%ifarch x86_64
%define arch %{nil}
%elifarch aarch64
%define arch arm64-
%endif
```
</Callout>
