# Policy

## Submission

- Use common sense.
- When it comes to submissions, anything is fair game, assuming that our policies are followed. However, there is a mild exception for GUI applications.

  - Please refrain from submitting applications that work perfectly fine as a Flatpak, unless there is a technical or UX justification for it. Examples of these exceptions are:
    - Terminal Emulators, as these often only work properly when run directly on the host system.
    - CLI/TUI applications, as the UX of Flatpak isn't optimized for these types of applications. (ex. requiring the user to call Flatpak, and then the RDNN of the app)
    - Applications that may require the user to manually modify its data files regularly (Prism Launcher, other modded game launchers, etc).
    - Applications that suffer major performance or technical issues due to sandboxing (IDEs, text editors, file managers, DAWs and other applications that rely on native plugin support like VSTs or LV2, etc).
    - System components, such as background system services, device drivers or important system configuration tools.
    - Libraries required to build or use the aforementioned packages.
    - Other applications may be excluded as per user demand, at the team's discretion.

- You must have the rights or permission to redistribute the packaged software. Besides that, there is no prohibition on proprietary licenses.
- Submissions must be maintained. We will reject submissions of unmaintained software.
- Submissions must not be malicious.
- Submissions should not conflict with Fedora's own packages.
- Submissions _should_ include an auto-update script, updating the package spec to the latest released version, with an exception for nightly packages.
- Submissions should be placed in the corresponding directory in `anda/`.
  - Each folder should only contain 1 spec file (recursively).
  - The following directories have a higher priority. Categorize your new package in the following order:
    1. `fonts/`
    2. `system/` (bootloaders, kernels, drivers, ...)
    3. `tools/buildsys/` (software used to build other software)
    4. `devs/` (tools for software development)
    5. `games/`
    6. `themes/`
    7. `docker/` (software related to containers)
    8. `desktops/` (applications specific to a Desktop Environment)
    9. `apps/` (GUI applications)
    10. `langs/` (software written in/for a specific programming language)
- When submitting a pull request, follow the provided template.
- Packages must follow our packaging guidelines, see our [contribution guide](https://github.com/terrapkg/packages/wiki/Contribute). When not specified, refer to [Fedora's packaging guidelines](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines).
- Low-quality contributions will be declined at the team's discretion.
- Submissions must have at least 1 approving reviewers from the Terra team.
- Do not include work-in-progress code or untested patches. See https://dont-ship.it/.
  {/* TODO: We need a replacement for CODEOWNERS not subject to GH's limitations */}
  {/* - Remember to add yourself to the [CODEOWNERS file](https://github.com/terrapkg/packages/tree/main/CODEOWNERS). */}
- Commits in a submission must be GPG signed with a GitHub verified key.

## Maintenance

- Anyone may make a PR to an already existing package, when doing so, please refer to the [submission policies](#Submission).
- Unmaintained packages may be removed at any time. Before doing so, we will create a GitHub issue to gauge community interest.
- Terra will only support the latest version of Fedora, if a package doesn't build on the next version of Fedora, we might hold it back.
  {/* - A review from the package's codeowner will be required before merging. */}
  {/* - In the case that a package's codeowner is unable to maintain the package or is unresponsive, we will open an issue gauging community interest. The Terra team will elect a new codeowner. */}
  {/* - If you would like to voluntarily resign your role of codeowner, please file a GitHub issue. */}

## Naming

Prefix/Suffix the packages in the following order
(that means nightly fonts should end with `-nightly-fonts`)

- Nightly packages must end with `-nightly`.
- Fonts must end with `-fonts`.
- Libraries should preferably start with `lib`.
- Packages with names that would conflict with Fedora's packages should be prefixed with `terra-`. This is usually used for packages that are severely outdated or poorly maintained in Fedora.
