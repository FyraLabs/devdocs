# Installing Arch Linux with Submarine

## Preparation

1. Write the Arch Linux live ISO to external media.

2. Create a new 16MB partition for Submarine on the external media. If using ChromeOS, `fdisk`/`cfdisk` are installed by default.

3. In ChromeOS, set the necessary flags for the Submarine partition with `cgpt add -i <partition number> -t kernel -P 15 -T 1 -S 1 /dev/sdX`, substituting &lt;partition number&gt; for the number of the Submarine partition and `/dev/sdX` for the block device of your external media.

4. Write `submarine-x86_64.kpart` to the Submarine partition created in step 2.

5. Reminder: to boot Submarine from external media, you first need to run the following commands as root

```bash
crossystem dev_boot_usb=1
crossystem dev_boot_signed_only=0
```

6. Reboot, and on the Developer Mode screen, press Ctrl+U to boot from external media.

## Partitioning

1. After booting the Arch Linux live ISO with Submarine, proceed with the regular manual installation of Arch Linux.

2. When partitioning the internal disk, again create a 16MB partition for Submarine. You do not need to create a EFI system partition (ESP) as Submarine does not use UEFI.

## Installing

1. After chrooting into the new install, install the `grub` package. As there is no ESP, skip the `grub-install` step and only run `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`. You must first create the `/boot/grub` directory otherwise `grub-mkconfig` will fail.

2. Install `curl` or `wget`, and `unzip` in order to download and extract Submarine. Here is the link again: https://nightly.link/FyraLabs/submarine/workflows/build/main/submarine-x86_64.zip

3. Arch does not package `cgpt`, but it is available in the AUR. Install `git`, and run the following commands

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/cgpt-bin.git
cd cgpt-bin
makepkg -si
```

4. As before, set the necessary flags for the Submarine partition on your internal disk.

5. Write `submarine-x86_64.kpart` to the Submarine partition.

6. Proceed with the rest of the Arch Linux installation as described in the installation guide on the ArchWiki.

## Postinstall

After you've finished installing, reboot and press Ctrl+D to boot from internal disk. If you did everything right, you should be looking at the Submarine boot menu. Select the number that corresponds to your system to boot into Arch.
