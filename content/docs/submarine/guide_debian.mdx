# Installing Debian Linux with Submarine

<Callout type="info">This works best when using a live ISO.</Callout>

## Partitioning

Ensure that your disk uses a GPT partition table.

1. Create a 16 MB partition to store Submarine.

2. Add the necessary flags by using `cgpt add -i <partition number> -t kernel -P 15 -T 1 -S 1 /dev/sdX`, don't forget to change the partition number and block device for your disk.

3. Flash `submarine-<arch>.kpart` to the partition you just made.

4. Create a second partition to store GRUB, this can be from 64 MB to 256 MB.

5. Last, create a third partition to store the root of your system. It needs to be at least 10 GB, but it would be most logical to fill up the rest of the disk with it.

## Installing

At this point, begin installing Debian. Proceed with the installation as normal until you get to the partitioning screen. Choose to partition manually and mount the partition that will be used to store GRUB as `/boot/efi` and the system partition as `/`. Now, finish installing Debian and the rest should be handled by the installer.

## Postinstall

After it finishes installing, boot from your disk. If you did everything right, you should be looking at the Submarine boot menu. Select the number that corresponds to your system to boot into Debian.

You should use [Tree's audio script](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio) to get the audio working. Note that this will install the chrultrabook kernel and you'll have a new entry in the boot menu.
